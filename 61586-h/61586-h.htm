      <div>My youth was ever constant to one dream,</div>
      <div>Though hope failed oft&mdash;so hopeless did it seem&mdash;</div>
      <div>That in the ripeness of my days I might</div>
      <div>Something achieve that should the world requite</div>
      <div>For my existence; for it was a pain</div>
      <div>To think that I should live and live in vain:</div>
      <div>And most my thoughts were turned towards the Muse,</div>
      <div>Though long she did my earnest prayers refuse,</div>
      <div>And left me darkling and despairing; then</div>
      <div>By happy chance there came within my ken</div>
      <div>A hapless poet, whom&mdash;I thank kind fate!&mdash;</div>

      <div>Now that no more on earth he sadly pines.</div>
      <div>This was a fortune such as I must ever</div>

      <div>A glint of light on one dim form did fall,</div>
      <div>Which, as I gazed more earnestly, became</div>
      <div>A living soul, discovered by the flame</div>
      <div>Of glowing inspiration which possessed</div>
      <div>Even now, as when he lived, the poet's breast.</div>
      <div>Did I deceive myself? Could it be true</div>
      <div>A new poetic star was in my view,</div>
      <div>And shining with a lustre bright and clear,</div>
      <div>Where, constellated in the heavenly sphere,</div>
      <div>Herbert and Vaughan, Crashaw and Milton shine</div>
      <div>With varying brightness, yet alike divine?</div>
      <div>I gazed again, but still that star burned on,</div>
      <div>And ever with a deeper radiance shone,</div>
      <div>Until I knew no Will-o'-th'-Wisp's false light,</div>
      <div>No meteor delusive mocked my sight,</div>

<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>


<p>It is with a more than ordinary degree of pleasure that I have
undertaken the task of introducing to readers of the present day the
writings of a hitherto unknown seventeenth-century poet. Centuries
had drawn their curtains around him, and he had died utterly, as it
seemed, out of the minds and memories of men; but the long night of
his obscurity is at length over, and his light henceforth, if I am not
much mistaken, is destined to shine with undiminished lustre as long as
England or the English tongue shall endure.</p>

<p>The author of the poems contained in the present volume belongs to
that small group of religious poets which includes Herbert, Vaughan,
and Crashaw, though he is much more nearly allied to the authors of
"The Temple" and "Silex Scintillans" than to the lyrist of Roman
Catholicism. Yet he is neither a follower nor an imitator of any of
these, but one who draws his inspiration from sources either peculiar
to himself or made his own by the moulding force of his own fervent
spirit.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span> Of the inner life of the author of these poems we have
abundant and satisfactory knowledge, for it is certain that no man's
writings ever furnished a clearer or more faithful mirror of their
author's personality than do those of Thomas Traherne. But of the
outward incidents of his life little can be told, though that little
is sufficient to show that he was a man of the finest and noblest
character. Profession and practice in his case went together, and he
was no less admirable as a man than he was as a poet and a minister
of religion. That he was a person of great sweetness of disposition,
of most happy temperament, and of singularly attractive character, is
certain; and to know so much of a man is to know everything we really
need to know. We cannot help, however, craving for more than this, and
we would give much indeed for such a record of Traherne as Walton gave
of Hooker, Herbert, Donne, and Sanderson. It is likely, indeed, that
other particulars of Traherne's career will in time be discovered; but
for the present the reader must be content with the scanty details
which are given in the following pages.</p>

<p>I regret to say that the inquiries which I have made, or caused to be
made, as to the time and place of Thomas Traherne's birth have been, so
far, without result. Probably he was born at Hereford, since his father
was a shoemaker in that town; but this is not certain. He may have
been born at Ledbury, which is a village a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span> few miles from Hereford,
for it seems pretty certain that his family was in some way connected
with that place. The earlier portion of the registers of that village
has been printed by the Parish Registers Society, and from this it
appears that there were "Trayernes" there in the sixteenth century.
Unfortunately, the portion of the Ledbury registers which covers the
period during which it is probable that our author was born is missing.
That also seems to be the case as regards the Hereford registers of the
same period. This is very disappointing; but we may hope that further
inquiries will prove more successful.</p>

<p>That the family from which the poet sprang was Welsh by descent seems
to be highly probable. It is true that the name is also found in
a slightly different form in Cornwall; but no doubt both branches
sprang from the same root at some distant period. The poet's character
and temperament, as displayed in his writings, almost proclaim his
nationality. Herbert and Vaughan, the two poets to whom he is most
near akin, were both Welsh by descent, and though neither of them is
deficient in warmth of feeling, Traherne certainly surpasses them in
the passionate fervour which he infuses into his writings. It is hardly
possible to think of them as having emanated from the cooler and less
enthusiastic Anglo-Saxon temperament.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span></p>

<p>All that I am able to say, then, as to the time of Traherne's birth is
that it was probably in the year 1636. Wood informs us that he became
a commoner of Brazennose College, Oxford, in 1652; and as the age at
which it was then usual for youths to commence their college career
was about sixteen, the above date seems the most likely one, though
it may, of course, have been a year earlier or later. His father was
in all probability the "John Traherne, Shoemaker," who is recorded to
have received, in conjunction with another person, "from Mistress Joyce
Jefferies the sum of three pounds for the shipping money."<a name="FNanchor_A_A" id="FNanchor_A_A"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> This lady
is also recorded to have paid money to one John Traherne (who may or
may not have been the same person) for training as the soldier whom she
had to provide for the Trained-bands.</p>

<p>John Traherne, it seems likely, was related to a man of considerable
note and influence in Hereford. This was Philip Traherne (the name is
sometimes spelt Traheron), who was twice Mayor of Hereford. He was
born in 1566, and was noted for his fidelity to the cause of King
Charles I., and, to follow the eulogium upon his tombstone, "for his
fervent zeal for the Established Church and clergy, and friendly and
affectionate behaviour in conversation, which rendered him highly
valuable to all the loyal party." He was mayor of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span> Hereford at the time
when the Scots attacked it. He died in 1645, aged 79. It would thus
appear that the Traherne family was one which occupied a fairly good
position in the middle class of the community. It would seem, however,
from a passage in Traherne's "Centuries of Meditations" ("Sitting in a
little obscure room in my father's poor house") that John Traherne's
circumstances were not very flourishing.</p>



<p>Of the poet's infancy and youth, the only source of information we have
is that which we find in his own writings. That the poems in which he
dwells so lovingly, and with so much enthusiasm, upon the happiness and
innocence of his infancy are somewhat coloured by the warmth of his
imagination may, perhaps, be suspected, but not, I think, with justice.
It is possible that he, to some extent, confused reflections of later
date with those which he represents himself to have experienced in his
infancy; but he was evidently a very precocious child, and the dawn of
consciousness and thought was surely much earlier in him than it is in
ordinary children. I think, therefore, we may trust the evidence of the
poems, in which he speaks of his infancy and childhood, as affording a
true, or but little idealised, picture of his early life. It might be
unsafe to depend upon the evidence of the poems if they stood alone,
but the earnestness with which he dwells upon the same topic, and
repeats in prose (in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span> his "Centuries of Meditations") what he asserts
in his verse, is sufficiently convincing. I know of no author whose
writings convey to the reader a stronger conviction of their author's
entire sincerity and absolute truthfulness than do those of Thomas
Traherne.</p>

<p>Traherne's "Centuries of Meditations" consists of a series of
reflections on religious and moral subjects, divided into short
numbered paragraphs. The manuscript (which was probably written in
the last years of his life, and therefore contains his most mature
thoughts) comprises four complete "Centuries," and ten numbers of a
fifth "Century." From the fact that it was left unfinished it would
seem that his labour upon it was cut short by his death. It was written
for the benefit and instruction of a lady, a friend from whom he had
received as a present the book in which it is written. It bears the
following inscription on the first page:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="ileft">"This book unto the friend of my best friend,</div>
      <div>As of the wisest love a mark, I send,</div>
      <div>That she may write my Maker's praise therein,</div>
      <div>And make herself thereby a cherubim."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In the third "Century" of the "Meditations" we find many details of
the author's infancy and childhood. I cannot do better that give the
greater part of these in the author's own words:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span></p>


<h4>I</h4>

<blockquote>

<p>Will you see the infancy of this sublime and celestial greatness?
Those pure and virgin apprehensions I had in my infancy, and that
divine light wherewith I was born, are the best unto this day
wherein I can see the universe. By the gift of God they attended
me into the world, and by His special favour I remember them
till now. Verily they form the greatest gift His wisdom could
bestow, for without them all other gifts had been dead and vain.
They are unattainable by books, and therefore I will teach them
by experience. Pray for them earnestly, for they will make you
angelical and wholly celestial. Certainly Adam in Paradise had not
more sweet and curious apprehensions of the world than I when I was
a child.</p></blockquote>


<h4>II</h4>

<blockquote>

<p>All appeared new and strange at first, inexpressibly rare and
delightful and beautiful. I was a little stranger which at my
entrance into the world was saluted and surrounded with innumerable
joys. My knowledge was Divine; I knew by intuition those things
which since my apostacy I collected again by the highest reason.
My very ignorance was advantageous. I seemed as one brought into
the estate of innocence. All things were spotless and pure and
glorious; yea, and infinitely mine and joyful and precious. I knew
not that there were any sins, or complaints or laws. I dreamed not
of poverties, contentions, or vices. All tears and quarrels were
hidden from mine eyes. Everything was at rest, free and immortal.
I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span> knew nothing of sickness or death or exaction. In the absence of
these I was entertained like an angel with the works of God in their
splendour and glory; I saw all in the peace of Eden; heaven and
earth did sing my Creator's praises, and could not make more melody
to Adam than to me. All Time was Eternity, and a perpetual Sabbath.
Is it not strange that an infant should be heir of the whole world,
and see those mysteries which the books of the learned never unfold?</p></blockquote>


<h4>III</h4>

<blockquote>

<p>The corn was orient and immortal wheat which never should be reaped
nor was ever sown. I thought it had stood from everlasting to
everlasting. The dust and stones of the street were as precious
as gold: the gates were at first the end of the world. The green
trees when I saw them first through one of the gates transported
and ravished me; their sweetness and unusual beauty made my heart
to leap, and almost mad with ecstacy, they were such strange and
wonderful things. The Men! O what venerable and reverend creatures
did the aged seem! Immortal Cherubims! And young men glittering and
sparkling angels, and maids strange seraphic pieces of life and
beauty! Boys and girls tumbling in the street were moving jewels: I
knew not that they were born or should die. But all things abided
eternally as they were in their proper places. Eternity was manifest
in the Light of the Day, and something infinite behind everything
appeared, which talked with my expectation and moved my desire. The
City seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span> stand in Eden or to be built in Heaven. The streets
were mine, the temple was mine, the people were mine, their clothes
and gold and silver were mine, as much as their sparkling eyes,
fair skins, and ruddy faces. The skies were mine, and so were the
sun and moon and stars, and all the world was mine; and I the only
spectator and enjoyer of it. I knew no churlish proprieties, nor
bounds nor divisions; but all proprieties and divisions were mine,
all treasures and the possessors of them. So that with much ado I
was corrupted, and made to learn the dirty devices of this world,
which now I unlearn, and become, as it were, a little child again
that I may enter into the Kingdom of God.</p></blockquote>

<p>These passages are succeeded in the MS. by the poem entitled "The
Approach," which the reader will find at page 31 of the present volume.</p>

<p>In the following sections of the "Meditations" the author tells how
these thoughts were first dimmed, and afterwards almost entirely lost
owing to the evil influence of those around him. It is clear that his
parents failed to appreciate the fact that their child was of a very
uncommon type, and that the ordinary methods of dealing with children
were inapplicable in his case. His early and innocent thoughts, he
says, were quite obliterated by the influence of a bad education. He
found that those around him were immersed in the trivial cares and
vanities of common life; that they were wholly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span> wrapped up in the
outward shows of things, and were moved only by common and mercenary
motives. Alas! this is the discovery that every poet makes, and it
is this which constitutes the tragedy of life for him. Had any one,
Traherne says, spoken to him on the great and sublime truths of God and
Nature; had he been taught that God was good, and had made him the sole
heir of a glorious universe; had he been assured that earth was better
than gold, and water, every drop of it, a precious jewel, he would have
thankfully received and gladly believed the lessons. But instead of
this they tried to instil into his mind the lessons of selfishness and
worldly wisdom.</p>

<p>It was a difficult matter to persuade me that the tinseled ware upon
a hobby horse was a fine thing. They did impose upon me and obtrude
their gifts that made me believe a ribbon or a feather curious. I
could not see where was the curiousness or fineness. And to teach me
that a purse of gold was at any value seemed impossible, the art by
which it becomes so, and the reasons for which it is accounted so
were so deep and hidden to my inexperience. So that nature is still
nearest to natural things, and farthest off from preternatural; and
to esteem that the reproach of nature is an excuse in them only who
are unacquainted with it. Natural things are glorious, and to know
them glorious; but to call things preternatural natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</a></span> monstrous.
Yet all they do it who esteem gold, silver, houses, land, clothes,
&amp;c., the riches of nature, which are indeed the riches of invention.
Nature knows no such riches, but art and error makes them. Not the
God of Nature, but sin only was the parent of them. The riches of
Nature are our souls and bodies, with all their faculties, senses,
and endowments. And it had been the easiest thing in the whole world
[to teach me] that all felicity consisted in the enjoyment of all
the world, that it was prepared for me before I was born, and that
nothing was more divine and beautiful.</p></blockquote>

<p>Surely Traherne was here anticipating much which seems to belong to a
far later date! The doctrine here urged is in essentials the same as
that which was insisted upon by Rousseau and other philosophers of the
eighteenth century. Shelley himself hardly enforced the idea of the
return to nature more strenuously than Traherne does in this passage.
"Natural things are glorious and to know them glorious"&mdash;is not this
the whole burden of Walt Whitman's poetry? Nay, is it not the whole
burden of all poetry worthy of the name?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Thoughts are the most present things to thoughts, and of the most
powerful influence. My Soul was only apt and disposed to great
things; but souls to souls are like apples, one being rotten rots
another. When I began to speak and go, nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</a></span> began to be present
to me but what was present to me in their thoughts. Nor was anything
present to me any other way than it was so to them. The glass of
imagination was the only mirror wherein anything was represented or
appeared to me. All things were absent which they talked not of. So
I began among my playfellow's to prize a drum, a fine coat, a penny,
a gilded book, &amp;c., who before never dreamed of any such wealth.
Goodly objects to drown all the knowledge of Heaven and Earth! As
for the Heavens and Sun and Stars, they disappeared, and were no
more unto me than the bare walls. So that the strange riches of
man's invention quite overcame the riches of nature, being learned
more laboriously and in the second place.</p></blockquote>

<p>By this, Traherne proceeds, parents and nurses should learn the right
way of teaching children. Nothing is easier than to teach the truth
because the nature of the thing confirms the teaching; whereas to teach
children to value "gugaus," baubles, and rattles puts false ideas into
their heads, and blots out all noble and divine thoughts, rendering
them uncertain about everything, and dividing them from God. "Verily,"
he says, "there is no savage nation under the cope of Heaven that is
more absurdly barbarous than the Christian World.... I am sure that
those barbarous people that go naked come nearer to Adam, God, and
Angels in the simplicity of their wealth, though not in knowledge."</p>

<p>Being swallowed up therefore in the miserable gulf of idle talk
and worthless vanities, thenceforth I lived among shadows, like a
prodigal son feeding upon husks with swine. A comfortless wilderness
full of thorns and troubles the world was or worse: a waste place
covered with idleness and play, and shops, and markets, and taverns.
As for churches they were things I did not understand, and schools
were a burden: so that there was nothing in the world worth the
having or enjoying but my game and sport, which also was a dream,
and being passed wholly forgotten. So that I had wholly forgotten
all goodness, bounty, comfort, and glory; which things are the very
brightness of the Glory of God, for lack of which therefore He was
unknown.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>Yet sometimes in the midst of these dreams I should come a little
to myself, so far as to feel I wanted something, secretly to
expostulate with God for not giving me riches, to long after an
unknown happiness, to grieve that the world was so empty and to be
dissatisfied with my present state because it was vain and forlorn.
I had heard of Angels and much admired that here upon earth nothing
should be but dirt and streets and gutters. For as for the pleasures
that were in great men's houses I had not seen them: and it was my
real happiness they were unknown. For because nothing deluded me I
was the more inquisitive.</p></blockquote>

<h4>XVI</h4>

<blockquote>

<p>Once I remember (I think I was about four years old) when I thus
reasoned with myself. Sitting in a little obscure room in my
father's poor house: If there be a God certainly He must be Infinite
in Goodness, and that I was prompted to, by a real whispering
instinct of nature. And if He be Infinite in Goodness and a perfect
Being in Wisdom and Love, certainly He must do most glorious things
and give us infinite riches; how comes it to pass, therefore, that
I am so poor? Of so scanty and narrow a fortune, enjoying few and
obscure comforts? I thought I could not believe Him a God to me
unless all His power were employed to glorify me. I knew not then
my Soul or Body, nor did I think of the Heavens and the Earth, the
Rivers and the Stars, the Sun or the Seas: all those were lost and
absent from me. But when I found them made out of nothing for me,
then I had a God indeed whom I could praise and rejoice in.</p></blockquote>


<h4>XVII</h4>

<blockquote>

<p>Sometimes I should be alone and without employment, when suddenly
my Soul would return to itself, and forgetting all things in the
whole world which mine eyes had seen, would be carried away to the
end of the earth, and my thoughts would be deeply engaged with
inquiries&mdash;How the Earth did end? Whether walls did bound it or
sudden precipices? Or whether the Heavens by degrees did come to
touch it, so that the faces of the Earth and Heaven were so near
that a man with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[xxvii]</a></span> difficulty could creep under? Whatever I could
imagine was inconvenient, and my reason being posed was quickly
wearied. What also upheld the Earth (because it was heavy) and kept
it from falling; whether pillars or dark waters? And if any upheld
these, what then upheld those, and what again those, of which I saw
there would be no end? Little did I think that the Earth was round
and the World so full of Beauty, Light, and Wisdom. When I saw
that, I knew by the perfection of the work there was a God, and was
satisfied and rejoiced. People underneath and fields and flowers,
with another Sun and another Day pleased me mightily; but more when
I knew it was the same Sun that served them by Night that served us
by day.</p></blockquote>


<h4>XVIII</h4>

<blockquote>

<p>Sometimes I should soar above the stars, and inquire how the Heavens
ended, and what was beyond them? Concerning which by no means could
I receive satisfaction. Sometimes my thoughts would carry me to the
Creation, for I had heard now that the World which at first I had
thought was Eternal had a beginning: how therefore that beginning
was, and why it was; why it was no sooner, and what was before,
I mightily desired to know. By all which I easily perceived my
Soul was made to live in communion with God in all places of His
dominion, and to be satisfied with the highest reason in all things.
After which it so eagerly aspired that I thought all the gold and
silver in the world but dirt in comparison of satisfaction in any
of these. Sometimes I wondered why men were made no bigger? I would
have had a man as big as a giant, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[xxviii]</a></span> giant as big as a castle, and a
castle as big as the Heavens. Which yet would not serve, for there
was infinite space beyond the Heavens, and all was defective and but
little in comparison; and for man to be made infinite, I thought it
would be to no purpose, and it would be inconvenient. Why also there
was not a better Sun and better Stars, a better Sea, and better
Creatures I much admired. Which thoughts produced that poem upon
moderation which afterwards was written.</p></blockquote>

<p>Following this the author quotes a part of the poem he refers to,
which, as it is printed on page 132, need not be given here. The
argument of his verses is that everything is for the best and in the
best possible proportion:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<blockquote>

<p>These liquid clear satisfactions were the emanations of the
highest reason, but not achieved till a long time afterwards. In
the meantime I was sometimes, though seldom, visited and inspired
with new and more vigorous desires after that Bliss which Nature
whispered and suggested to me. Every new thing quickened my
curiosity, and raised my expectation. I remember once, the first
time I came into a magnificent and noble dining-room and was left
there alone, I rejoiced to see the gold and state and carved
imagery, but when all was dead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxix" id="Page_xxix">[xxix]</a></span> and there was no motion, I was
weary of it and departed dissatisfied. But afterwards when I saw
it full of lords and ladies and music and dancing, the place which
once seemed not to differ from a solitary den had now entertainment
and nothing of tediousness in it. By which I perceived (upon a
reflection made long after) that men and women are, when well
understood, a principal part of our true felicity. By this I found
also that nothing that stood still could, by doing so, be a part of
Happiness: and that affection, though it were invisible, was the
best of motions. But the august and glorious exercise of virtue was
more solemn and divine, which yet I saw not. And that all men and
angels should appear in Heaven.</p></blockquote>


<h4>XXIII</h4>

<blockquote>

<p>Another time, in a lowering and sad evening, being alone in the
field, when all things were dead and quiet, a certain want and
horror fell upon me, beyond imagination. The unprofitableness and
silence of the place dissatisfied me, its wildness terrified me;
from the utmost ends of the earth fears surrounded me. How did I
know but dangers might suddenly arise from the East, and invade me
from the unknown regions beyond the seas? I was a weak and little
child and had forgotten there was a man alive in the earth. Yet
something also of hope and expectation comforted me from every
border. This taught me that I was concerned in all the world: and
that in the remotest borders the causes of peace delight me, and
the beauties of the earth, when seen, were made to entertain me:
that I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxx" id="Page_xxx">[xxx]</a></span> made to hold a communion with the secrets of Divine
Providence in all the world: that a remembrance of all the joys I
had from my birth ought always to be with me: that the presence of
Cities, Temples, and Kingdoms ought to sustain me, and that to be
alone in the world was to be desolate and miserable. The comfort of
houses and friends, and the clear assurance of treasures everywhere,
God's care and love, His Wisdom, Goodness, and Power, His Presence
and watchfulness in all the ends of the earth were my strength and
assurance for ever: and that those things being absent to my eye
were my joys and consolations: as present to my understanding as the
wideness and emptiness of the Universe which I saw before me.</p></blockquote>


<h4>XXIV</h4>

<blockquote>

<p>When I heard of any new Kingdom beyond the seas the light and glory
of it entered into me, it rose up within me, and I was enlarged
wonderfully. I entered into it, I saw its commodities, springs,
meadows, riches, inhabitants, and became possessor of that new
room as if it had been prepared for me, so much was I magnified
and delighted in it. When the Bible was read my spirit was present
in other ages. I saw the light and splendour of them, the Land of
Canaan, the Israelites entering into it, the ancient glory of the
Amorites, their peace and riches, their cities, houses, vines,
and fig-trees, the long prosperity of their Kings, their milk and
honey, their slaughter and destruction, with the joys and triumphs
of God's people. All which entered into me, and God among them. I
saw all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxi" id="Page_xxxi">[xxxi]</a></span> and felt all in such a lively manner as if there had been
no other way to those places but in spirit only. This shewed me
the liveliness of interior presence, and that all ages were for
most glorious ends accessible to my understanding, yea with it, yea
within it. For without changing place in myself I could behold and
enjoy all those. Anything, when it was proposed, though it was a
thousand ages ago being always before me.</p></blockquote>

<p>Some few other passages relating to Traherne's boyhood might be quoted;
but as I hope soon to publish the "Centuries of Meditations" in
complete form, it is hardly necessary to give further extracts here. I
have quoted enough, I trust, to create a desire in the reader's mind to
see the whole work in print. I have found the narrative so interesting
myself that I would fain hope it will be not less so to others. It
displays with a vividness seldom equalled the eager, enthusiastic,
thoughtful, affectionate, and, above all, poetic character of its
author. It was doubtless because he retained in his manhood so much of
the fresh, unspoiled, and uncorrupted spirit of his youth that he was
able to give such an engaging picture of his early years. It bears the
stamp of veracity and sincerity in every line; and leaves no room in
the reader's mind (as so many autobiographies do) for the suspicion
that the author was posing himself in the most favourable light, and
suppressing the darker shades of his portraiture. I do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxii" id="Page_xxxii">[xxxii]</a></span> not think there
is anything resembling it in English literature; nor could more than
one or two other English poets have written such a narrative. It is
fortunate indeed that the "Centuries of Meditations," which so narrowly
escaped destruction or oblivion, should have been preserved to afford
us this valuable record of the inner life of a spirit touched to such
fine issues as was that of Thomas Traherne.</p>

<p>Turning from the brilliant illumination of our author's own account
of his youthful experiences it is very disappointing to find that no
information about him from external sources can be discovered before
the time when he became an Oxford undergraduate. But we may, I think,
conclude with little chance of error that the course of his early life
was somewhat as follows: His parents, seeing the precocity and unusual
promise of their child, determined to give him the best education
within their power, and therefore sent him to the local Grammar School.
This was founded by Bishop Gilbert in 1386. While there he must have
distinguished himself so much by his good conduct and aptitude for
learning that some patron&mdash;or perhaps some of his relatives who were
in a better position than his father&mdash;furnished the means to enable
him to proceed to Oxford and become a student there. His course at the
University is thus related in the <i>Athenæ Oxonienses</i>:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiii" id="Page_xxxiii">[xxxiii]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Thomas Traherne, a shoemaker's son of Hereford, was entered a
Commoner of Brasen-nose College on the first day of March, 1652,
took one degree in Arts, left the House for a time, entered into the
sacred function, and in 1661 he was actually created Master of Arts.
About that time he became Rector of Credinhill, commonly called
Crednell, near to the city of Hereford ... and in 1669 Bachelor of
Divinity.</p></blockquote>

<p>To the above it may perhaps be as well to add the exact dates of the
degrees bestowed upon him at the University. He was made Bachelor of
Arts on October 13, 1656; Master of Arts on November 6, 1661; and
Bachelor of Divinity on December 11, 1669. Why or when he "left the
House for a time" does not appear; possibly it was on account of the
political troubles of the period.</p>

<p>When at the University we may be certain that Traherne's inclination
and natural genius would lead him to study for the ministry; and he
was undoubtedly an earnest and diligent student of the history and
doctrines of the Christian faith, and more especially of those of the
Church of England. He found in that communion his ideal Church. We
have seen that Philip Traherne, the Mayor of Hereford, was noted for
his "fervent zeal for the Established Church and clergy"&mdash;and probably
we shall not be wrong in thinking that the Trahernes generally were
members of the English Church. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxiv" id="Page_xxxiv">[xxxiv]</a></span> circumstance doubtless had its
influence in determining the faith of Thomas Traherne; but his own
deeply fervent and religious nature found in the national faith, as
George Herbert had found before him, the peace and satisfaction which
he could find nowhere else. That the Anglican Church can boast of
having attracted to its service such fine spirits as those of Herbert,
Vaughan, Traherne, and the many others that might be mentioned, is
surely one of its greatest honours.</p>

<p>We have the evidence of Antony à Wood and that of Traherne's book
entitled "Roman Forgeries" to prove that he was an unwearied student
of the antiquities of the Church, of its Fathers, Councils, and
Doctrines. But the best evidence on this point is to be found in the
"Advertisement to the Reader" prefixed to "Roman Forgeries." Herein
the author gives us a lively account of a discussion which took place
between himself and a Roman Catholic gentleman on the questions in
dispute between the two Churches. This passage must be quoted in full,
for the story is so vividly told that the reader becomes almost a
spectator of the scene:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Before I stir further I shall add one passage which befel me in the
<i>Schools</i> as I was studying these things, and searching the most
old and authentic records in pursuance of them. One evening as I
came out of the Bodleian Library, which is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxv" id="Page_xxxv">[xxxv]</a></span> glory of Oxford,
and this nation, at the stairs-foot I was saluted by a person that
has deserved well of scholars and learning, who being an intimate
friend of mine, told me there was a gentleman, his cousin, pointing
to a grave person, in the quadrangle, a man that had spent many
thousand pounds in promoting Popery, and that he had a desire to
speak with me. The gentleman came up to us of his own accord: we
agreed, for the greater liberty and privacy, to walk abroad into
the New Parks. He was a notable man, of an eloquent tongue, and
competent reading, bold, forward, talkative enough; he told me,
that the Church of Rome had eleven millions of martyrs, seventeen
Oecumenical Councils, above one hundred Provincial Councils, all the
Doctors, all the Fathers, Unity, Antiquity, Consent, &amp;c. I desired
him to name <i>one</i> of his eleven millions of martyrs, excepting
those that died for treason in Queen Elizabeth's and King James his
days: for the martyrs of the primitive times, were martyrs of the
<i>Catholic</i>, but not of the <i>Roman</i> Church: they only being martyrs
of the Roman Church, that die for <i>transubstantiation</i>, the <i>Pope's
Supremacy</i>, the doctrine of <i>Merits</i>, <i>Purgatory</i>, and the like.
So many he told me they had, but I could not get him to name one.
As for his Councils, Antiquities and Fathers, I asked him what he
would say, if I could clearly prove that the Church of Rome was
guilty of <i>forging</i> them, so far that they had published <i>Canons</i>
in the <i>Apostles</i> names, and invented <i>Councils</i> that never were,
forged <i>letters</i> of Fathers, and <i>Decretal Epistles</i>, in the name of
the first Bishops and Martyrs of Rome, made 5, 6, 700 years after
they were dead, to the utter disguising and defacing of antiquity,
for the first 480 years next after our Saviour? "Tush, these are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvi" id="Page_xxxvi">[xxxvi]</a></span>
nothing but lies," quoth he, "whereby the Protestants endeavour to
disgrace the Papists." Sir, answered I, you are a scholar, and have
heard of Isidore, Mercator, James Merlin, Peter Crabbe, Laurentius
Surius, Severinus Binius Labbè, Cossartius, and the Collectio Regia,
books of vast bulk and price, as well as of great majesty and
magnificence: you met me this evening at the Library door; if you
please to meet me there to-morrow morning at eight of the clock,
I will take you in; and we will go from class to class, from book
to book, and there I will first shew in your own authors, that you
publish such instruments for good <i>Records</i>: and then prove, that
those instruments are downright frauds and forgeries? "What hurt is
that to the Church of Rome?" said he. No! (cried I, amazed) Is it no
hurt to the Church of Rome, to be found guilty of <i>forging Canons</i>
in the <i>Apostles</i> names, and <i>Epistles</i> in the <i>Fathers'</i> names,
which they never made? Is it nothing in <i>Rome</i> to be guilty of
counterfeiting <i>Decrees</i> and <i>Councils</i>, and <i>Records of Antiquity</i>?
<i>I have done with you!</i> whereupon I turned from him as an obdurate
person. And with this I thought it meet to acquaint the Reader.</p></blockquote>

<p>No other particulars of Traherne's University career are now available,
but those which I have related are sufficient to show that it was not
an unsuccessful one. It is plain that he made his way entirely by his
own ability, for he could have had no other means of advancing himself.</p>

<p>It appears from a passage in our author's "Centuries of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxvii" id="Page_xxxvii">[xxxvii]</a></span> Meditations"
that there was at one time a conflict in his mind as to his future
course in life. He debated with himself as to whether he should
pursue the path that might lead to worldly prosperity, at the cost
of sacrificing or suppressing his higher aspirations, or whether he
should, at the risk of poverty and obscurity, follow out the promptings
of his better self. Such a conflict, in his case, could have only one
result:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>When I came into the country, and being seated among silent trees
and woods and hills, had all my time in mine own hands, I resolved
to spend it all, whatever it cost me, in the search of Happiness,
and to satiate the burning thirst which Nature had enkindled in me
from my youth. In which I was so resolute that I chose rather to
live upon ten pounds a year, and to go in leather clothes and to
feed upon bread and water, so that I might have all my time clearly
to myself, than to keep many thousands per annum in an estate of
life where my time would be devoured in care and labour. And God was
so pleased to accept of that desire that from that time to this I
have had all things plentifully provided for me without any care at
all, my very study of Felicity making me more to prosper than all
the care in the whole world. So that through His blessing I live a
free and a kingly life, as if the world were turned again into Eden,
or, much more, as it is at this day.</p></blockquote>

<p>Truly a memorable resolution! which has had not too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxviii" id="Page_xxxviii">[xxxviii]</a></span> many parallels,
though the failure to make it has caused many a man of fine abilities
to fall into the ranks of those whom the world has conquered and
subdued to its own purposes. One remembers the similar resolution of
the great founder of Quakerism, which Traherne might possibly have
heard of. One thinks also of Thoreau and of his life in the woods; and
of the few others who have dared to live out their own lives in their
own way, regardless of the disdain or censure of the worldly-minded.
That nothing but good came to Traherne from his resolution we might
have been sure even if he had not himself told us so; for what harm
can come to those who are animated with such a spirit as his? The
spiritually minded derive their sustenance from the spirit, and are the
richer on the ten pounds a year which Traherne speaks of than are the
masters of untold wealth who are spiritually destitute.</p>

<p>At what period Traherne came to the decision which he has thus recorded
does not appear; but it seems probable it was at the time when, as
Wood tells us, he left the University for a time. Wood places the
commencement of his ministry at Credenhill at about 1661, when he was
made Master of Arts. This, however, seems to be an error. Mr. E. H.
W. Dunkin has kindly informed me that he has in his possession a copy
of a manuscript preserved at Lambeth Library (MS. 998) containing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxxix" id="Page_xxxix">[xxxix]</a></span>
particulars of admissions to Benefices <i>temp.</i> Commonwealth, in which
the following entry appears:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Thomas Traherne, clerk, admitted 30 Dec., 1657, by the Commissioners
for the Approbation of Public Preachers to the Rectory of Crednell,
alias Creddenhill, Co. Hereford: patron Amabella, Countess Dowager
of Kent.</p></blockquote>

<p>In 1657 Traherne could not have been more than 21 or 22 years of
age&mdash;hardly old enough, one would think, to assume entire charge of the
parish. Possibly at first he only acted as assistant to the minister
whom he afterwards succeeded.</p>

<p>Of the course of Traherne's life at Credenhill nothing is now known,
but, as far as outward events were concerned, it was doubtless quiet
and uneventful. He remained there, it would appear, for rather more
than nine and a half years. Then he was summoned to London to become
private chaplain to Sir Orlando Bridgman, who, on August 30, 1667, was
created Lord Keeper of the Seals. Whether he owed his promotion to a
friend's recommendation, or whether he had, before this time, become
personally acquainted with Sir Orlando, we do not know, but it is
certain that he must henceforth have been highly esteemed and valued
by his patron. When Bridgman was, in 1672, deprived of the Seals, and
went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xl" id="Page_xl">[xl]</a></span> into retirement, he still retained Traherne in his service, and
it was in his patron's house at Teddington, about three months after
the latter's decease, that he died. We may indeed feel certain that a
mutual regard and even affection existed between them; and perhaps it
is not too great a stretch of imagination to think that the death of
Traherne may have been hastened by his grief at the loss of his patron.</p>

<p>Sir Orlando Bridgman was not only a very able lawyer, but also an
honourable, conscientious, and upright statesman. He was, perhaps, a
little wanting in strength of character, and therefore appeared to his
contemporaries to be something of a trimmer. He was a royalist, and
remained such all through the Civil War and the Commonwealth; though it
appears that during the last years of Cromwell's reign he had in some
degree made his peace with the Protector. But he was not disposed to
be a mere tool in the hands of the Court party. He was made Keeper of
the Seals because it was supposed that he would have been subservient
to the designs of the ministry then in power; but when it was found
that he was not disposed to be a compliant tool in their hands he
was dismissed from his office. He had nothing in him of a Scroggs
or a Jeffries, and was therefore no fit instrument of the crew of
unscrupulous and corrupt intriguers who then misruled the country. That
he was of a most charitable disposition&mdash;though he has not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xli" id="Page_xli">[xli]</a></span> hitherto, I
believe, received credit for the fact&mdash;we have sufficient evidence. In
Traherne's "Christian Ethicks" we find the following passage (p. 471):
"My Lord Bridgman, late Lord Keeper, confessed himself in his Will
to be but a Steward of his Estate, and prayed God to forgive all his
offences in getting, mis-spending, or not spending it as he ought to
do. And that after many Charitable and Pious Works, perhaps surmounting
his estate tho concealed from the notice or knowledge of the world."</p>

<p>It has been seen from one of the extracts quoted from "Centuries of
Meditations" that Traherne esteemed himself fortunate in having "all
things plentifully provided for me without any care at all, my very
study of Felicity making me more to prosper than all the care in the
whole world." That he was perfectly sincere in this statement, and that
he had all the riches and advancement he required, is certain; but very
few men, and certainly no ambitious man, under the same circumstances
would have made such a declaration. To the worldly-minded his destiny
must have seemed a poor, if not mean one. To be the parson of two small
and obscure parishes, and the private chaplain of the Keeper of the
Seals, while possessing abilities which would have adorned the highest
possible station, must have seemed, to a less happily constituted
temperament, a fate which would have justified much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlii" id="Page_xlii">[xlii]</a></span> repining and
discontent. That Traherne was not merely contented but happy under such
circumstances is but one more proof that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div>Happiness to no outward cause we owe,</div>
      <div>From inward sources only doth it flow.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The position of chaplain to Lord Bridgman must have brought Traherne
into contact with many distinguished persons of the time; but no trace
of his intercourse with them seems now to be discoverable, save in one
instance. John Aubrey, the famous gossip, to whose undiscriminating
industry we are indebted for the preservation of much chaff indeed, but
also for not a little precious wheat, in his "Miscellanies," under the
heading "Apparitions," gives us a remarkable reference to our author. I
quote the passage in full:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Mr. Trahern, B.D. (chaplain to Sir Orlando Bridgman, Lord Keeper),
a learned and sober person, was son of a shoemaker in Hereford:
one night as he lay in bed, the moon shining very bright, he saw
the phantom of one of the apprentices, sitting in a chair in his
red waistcoat, and head-band about his head, and strap upon his
knee; which apprentice was really in bed and asleep with another
fellow-apprentice, in the same chamber, and saw him. The fellow was
living, 1671. Another time, as he was in bed, he saw a basket come
sailing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliii" id="Page_xliii">[xliii]</a></span> in the air, along by the valence of his bed; I think he
said there was fruit in the basket: it was a phantom. From himself.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is highly probable that it was Aubrey who furnished Wood with the
account of Traherne which appears in the <i>Athenæ Oxonienses</i>, and
doubtless he could have given us much more information about him had
he chosen to do so. But he was incapable of appreciating so fine a
spirit as Traherne's; nor was the latter likely to reveal to him the
profounder depths of his nature. It is much to be regretted that Aubrey
gives us such a confused account of what he was told. The stories were
doubtless related to him at his own direct request, he being ever eager
to collect accounts of the marvellous and the supernatural. It seems
evident that Traherne attached little importance to these two visions,
purposeless as they apparently were, and as visions of the kind usually
are. No one nowadays would attribute such phantoms of the brain to any
supernatural cause, nor does it appear that Traherne himself did. I
find no trace in his writings of a belief in the common superstitions
of his time as to ghosts, witches, or evil spirits.</p>

<p>The date of the interview in which Traherne related these things to
Aubrey is fixed by the date given in it (1671) to a period within two
or three years of the poet's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xliv" id="Page_xliv">[xliv]</a></span> death. During these latter years he was,
according to Wood, minister of the parish of Teddington, Middlesex. It
was there that Sir Orlando Bridgman's country residence was situated;
and it was doubtless owing to his lordship's influence that Traherne
was appointed minister. That he did hold that position seems to be
certain, though, curiously enough, his name does not appear in the list
of ministers of the parish which is given in Newcourt's "Repertorium
Ecclesiasticum." Perhaps this may be accounted for by the fact that
though Traherne was actually the working minister, the post was
nominally held by a clerical pluralist of the time. The succession of
curates as given by Newcourt during the period of Traherne's connection
with the parish is as follows: 1664,&mdash;Badcock; 1668, Car. Bryan; 1673,
Joh. Graves; 1677, Jacobus Elsby.</p>

<p>It was not until the year before his death that the first fruit of
Traherne's long and laborious studies was offered to the readers of
the time. His poems&mdash;or some of them, at least&mdash;were written early
in life, for he speaks of one of them as having been written "long
since"; but his "Roman Forgeries," "Christian Ethicks," and "Centuries
of Meditations" were almost certainly his latest productions. Without
undervaluing his two published works, it must be regretted that he did
not send to the press in preference to them his poems, which would
then have had the advantage of his own supervision, and would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlv" id="Page_xlv">[xlv]</a></span>
saved his name from the total obscurity in which it has now been sunk
for upwards of two centuries. But doubtless he did not anticipate so
untimely an end of his career, and may well have preferred to make his
first appearance in print as a serious student and thinker rather than
as a poet. I feel sure that he did not undervalue his poems (what poet
ever did?); but he must have believed that his prose writings were
better calculated to influence the world, as he desired to influence
it, than they were. His "Roman Forgeries" and "Christian Ethicks"
probably cost him far more labour and hard thought than his poems did;
and authors, it has been observed, usually value most highly the works
which have cost them the greatest pains.</p>

<p>It was in 1673 that "Roman Forgeries" was published. There never was
a period in the history of England when theological questions were
more hotly debated than during the second half of the seventeenth
century. Political and theological questions were then far more closely
connected than is now the case, so that a double degree or vehemence
was imparted to all the subjects of dispute which then divided the
nation. Hence it was that a continual flood of partisan books and
pamphlets issued from the press, to contemplate which nowadays is to be
filled with a melancholy sense of the energy and intellect which our
ancestors wasted in angry disputations and futile controversies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvi" id="Page_xlvi">[xlvi]</a></span></p>

<p>That Traherne should have plunged into this whirlpool of controversy
is, I must needs think, matter for regret. His "Roman Forgeries" is,
it is true, a very able work; and as to its main contentions a very
convincing one to those who need no convincing, and possibly even to
the very few Catholics who could be induced to peruse it. But most of
the latter, it is probable, would brush the whole question aside, as
did the Catholic gentleman whom Traherne encountered at Oxford, merely
exclaiming "What does it matter?"</p>

<p>As to the object of the work, the passage which I have quoted from
it on p. xxxiv will give the reader a good idea of its scope and
purpose. It is, in fact, an indictment of the Roman Church as being
guilty of the most flagrant forgeries of documents and falsifications
of historical facts for the purpose of supporting its spiritual and
temporal pretensions. To those who are able to take any interest in
its subject the book is by no means a dull one. Traherne, indeed, felt
such a lively concern in his theme that he has succeeded in infusing
much of his own animation into his pages. He deals his blows at his
adversaries with such hearty good will, and has so much confidence in
the justice of his cause, that the reader can hardly fail to sympathise
with so earnest a combatant. Yet, as I have said, one can hardly help
regretting that the book should have been written, for, well as it is
done,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlvii" id="Page_xlvii">[xlvii]</a></span> it might have been done equally well by a writer of far inferior
gifts, while it is impossible not to feel that Traherne was wasting his
genius in its composition.<a name="FNanchor_B_B" id="FNanchor_B_B"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_B" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<p>Within twelve months after the publication of "Roman Forgeries" its
author was dead. But he had, during the few months of life still
left to him, finished another long and elaborate work. This was his
"Christian Ethicks," a work of much more value and interest than his
first book, though it seems to have fallen still-born from the press,
and to have remained neglected and unknown ever since.</p>

<p>The satisfaction of seeing his second work in print was denied to its
author. He had sent it to the press, but was dead before the printing
of it was commenced. Sir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlviii" id="Page_xlviii">[xlviii]</a></span> Orlando died on June 25, 1674, and was
interred in the church at Teddington, where a monument was erected to
him. Three months afterwards Traherne died in his patron's house, and
was also buried in the church at Teddington under the reading-desk. Of
the exact date of his decease we are ignorant, but he was buried on
October 10, 1674.</p>

<p>About a fortnight before his death, Traherne sent for his friend, John
Berdo, and his sister-in-law, Susan Traherne, and in their presence
made his Will&mdash;a nuncupative one. This Will, which I have to thank my
friend, Gordon Goodwin, for communicating to me, was registered in
the Prerogative Court of Canterbury. It is a curious and interesting
document, and I have therefore printed it in full in the Appendix to
the present volume. From its terms, it is very evident that Traherne
had accumulated no wealth, and that he died possessed of little indeed
beyond his books and other personal effects.</p>

<p>At the time of his death Traherne was probably not more than
thirty-eight years of age, but certainly under forty. He was thus in
the very prime of life, and his intellect was in its fullest vigour.
Had he lived he would surely have produced a succession of works which
would have sensibly enriched our literature, for his industry was not
less remarkable than his ability and his learning. As it was, his
career must have seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xlix" id="Page_xlix">[xlix]</a></span> those who were capable of appreciating his
fine qualities a failure, for his books brought him little reputation;
and beyond the mention of him in the <i>Athenæ Oxonienses</i>, his name
quickly sank into entire oblivion, so to remain for upwards of two
centuries. A strange fate! the strangest, perhaps, that ever befell
an author of such fine genius. During all this period his manuscripts
were lying unknown and neglected, and exposed to all the accidents of
time and chance. Yet not altogether so, for it seems that those into
whose hands his papers fell had at least a dim perception of their
value. Twenty-five years after his death a little book stole into the
world the title of which was as follows: "A Serious and Patheticall
Contemplation of the Mercies of God, in several most Devout and Sublime
Thanksgivings for the same. Published by the Reverend Doctor Hickes
at the request of a friend of the Authors." It was the fortunate
issue of this work of Traherne's that, after the lapse of upwards of
two centuries, was to be the means of identifying him as the author
of the poems contained in the present volume, which else might now
be masquerading as those of Henry Vaughan. But for this we have not
altogether to thank the friend of Traherne's who brought about the
issue of the "Serious and Patheticall Contemplation." He certainly
laid us under considerable obligations to him when he procured its
publication; but his curious idea that it was not to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_l" id="Page_l">[l]</a></span> purpose to
tell us the author's name might have caused it to remain for ever
unknown but for one clue that he gave us, which ultimately led to its
discovery.</p>

<p>The "Serious and Patheticall Contemplation" opens with a letter from
the Rev. George Hickes (then a well-known writer on theological
subjects), in which he says that the work was recommended to him
for publication by "a devout person who was a great Judge of Books
of Devotion, having given the world one already which had been well
received in three impressions." He intended, he says, to have written
a Preface to the book himself, but had received from a friend of the
deceased author an account of him, which rendered it unnecessary for
him "who can only tell how greatly the author of them wrote, but knew
not how greatly he lived" to fulfil his intention. Dr. Hickes's Letter
is followed by an Address "To the Reader," written by Traherne's
friend. As this contains the best and most valuable account of our
author which has descended to us, I need make no apology for quoting it
in full:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Tho' the unhappy decay of true Piety and the Immoralities of the Age
we live in may be a discouragement to the multiplying such Books
as this, yet on the other hand this degeneracy of Manners, and too
evident contempt of Religion makes it (it may be) the more necessary
to endeavour to retrieve the Spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_li" id="Page_li">[li]</a></span> of Devotion and the sacred
Fires of Primitive Christianity. And since 'tis hop'd this ensuing
Treatise may somewhat conduce to these noble Ends: It is thought
to be no unprofitable undertaking to commit it to the Press, it
being part of the Remains of a very devout Christian, who is long
since removed to the Regions of Beatified Spirits, to sing those
Praises and Hallelujahs, in which he was very vigourously employ'd
whilst he dwelt amongst us: and since somewhat of <i>Preface</i> is
become, as it were, a necessary part of every book, instead of any
particular <i>Dedication</i> (which is commonly over-stuft with Flattery
and Complements) I will only give thee some Account of the Author.
To tell thee who he was, is, I think, to no purpose: And therefore I
will only tell thee what he was, for that may possibly recommend the
following Thanksgivings and Meditations to thy use. He was a Divine
of the Church of England, of a very comprehensive Soul and very
acute Parts, so fully bent upon that Honourable Function in which
he was engaged; and so wonderfully transported with the Love of
God to Mankind, with the excellency of those Divine Laws which are
prescribed to us, and with those inexpressible Felicities to which
we are entitled by being created in, and redeemed to the Divine
Image that he dwelt continually amongst these thoughts with great
delight and satisfaction, spending most of his time when at home
in digesting his notions of these things into writing, and was so
full of them when abroad that those who would converse with him were
forced to endure some discourse upon these subjects, whether they
had any sense of Religion or not. And therefore to such he might be
sometimes thought troublesome, but his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lii" id="Page_lii">[lii]</a></span> company was very acceptable
to all such as had any inclination to Vertue and Religion. And tho'
he had the misfortune to come abroad into the world in the late
disordered Times, when the Foundations were cast down, and this
excellent Church laid in the dust, and dissolved into Confusion
and Enthusiasme; yet his Soul was of a more refin'd alloy, and his
Judgment in discerning of things more solid and considerate than to
be infected with that Leaven, and therefore became much in love with
the beautiful order and Primitive Devotions of this our excellent
Church. Insomuch that I believe he never failed any one day either
publickly or in his private Closet to make use of her publick
Offices, as one part of his devotion, unless some very unavoidable
business interrupted him. He was a man of a cheerful and sprightly
Temper, free from anything of the sourness or formality by which
some great pretenders to Piety rather disparage and misrepresent
true Religion than recommend it; and therefore was very affable and
pleasant in his conversation, ready to do all good offices to his
Friends, and Charitable to the Poor almost beyond his ability. But
being removed out of the Country to the service of the late Lord
Keeper Bridgman as his Chaplain, he died young and got early to
those blissful Mansions to which he at all times aspir'd.</p></blockquote>

<p>This eulogy of Traherne, it will be observed, was written twenty-five
years after his death, when the writer could have had no possible
motive to pen it, beyond a desire to do justice to the memory of his
friend.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liii" id="Page_liii">[liii]</a></span> It is a most attractive picture; but not, I am convinced, one
in which truth was sacrificed to flattery. It is exactly what might
have been inferred from the poems and "Centuries of Meditations"; but
since it does not always happen that an author's personality tallies
with that which might be deduced from his writings, it is fortunate
that the impression derived from Traherne's works is thus confirmed by
independent evidence. The poet was, it is plain, one of those rare and
enviable individuals in whom no jarring element is present, who come
into the world as into their rightful inheritance, and whose whole life
is a song of thankfulness for the happiness which they enjoy in it. His
was indeed</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div>A happy soul that all the way</div>
      <div>To Heaven hath a summer's day,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="p-left">and though we, who are not so constituted, and who may question whether
in a world, which to us seems to give at least as much reason for
lamenting as for rejoicing, any man has a right to be so happy as
Traherne was, the feeling is perhaps only an outcome of that envy which
those who are tortured with a thousand doubts and misgivings must needs
entertain for those who enjoy an existence of entire serenity.</p>

<p>It is fortunate that Traherne's friend, though he did not mention his
name, yet gave us a clue to him by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_liv" id="Page_liv">[liv]</a></span> mentioning that he was private
chaplain to Lord Keeper Bridgeman. Without this clue we should probably
have had to remain in ignorance of his authorship of the poems
contained in this volume: for though there was (as will be seen later
on) another clue, it was hidden away so deeply that it is unlikely it
would ever have been discovered. Why Traherne's friend should have
thought that it was not to the purpose to tell us who he was, and yet
gave us such a means of discovering him, is rather a puzzle; but we
have reason to be ever grateful to him for what he has told us, while
regretting that he has told us no more.</p>

<p>I must now give some account of Traherne's "Christian Ethicks." It
is so rare a book that I have only just obtained a copy of it, after
searching for it for nearly two years. Few books surely have had so
unfortunate a fate. If there is a better book of its kind in the
English language I have not been so fortunate as to meet with it. It
is a work full of eloquence, persuasiveness, sagacity, and piety.
While the author's concern, as might be expected, is chiefly with the
spiritual life, he is by no means destitute of worldly wisdom, and he
often exhibits a shrewdness and knowledge of human nature which would
scarcely be expected from him. Open the book anywhere you please you
can hardly fail to discover a fine thought finely expressed. How then
shall we account for the fact that the work has remained in total
obscurity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lv" id="Page_lv">[lv]</a></span> from the time of its first publication to the present day?
The fact that the author died before its appearance, and it was thus
thrown into the world without a parent or friend to foster it, was
no doubt in some degree accountable for its ill-fortune. It is true
that the author makes no appeal to the uninstructed or the fanatical,
and keeps throughout the work upon a higher level of thought than
the generality of readers can ascend to. He is somewhat too fond of
debating abstruse points of metaphysics, and of dwelling upon the
subtleties of theological speculation. Yet there is in the book enough,
one would think, of homely wisdom, and even of wit, to have secured it
a warm welcome from all those to whom it appealed.</p>

<p>I think the reader&mdash;since he is not likely to obtain a copy of
"Christian Ethicks," however much he may desire it&mdash;will be glad to
see a few extracts from it. And first I will quote a passage from
the chapter "Of Magnanimity." I do this because of its personal
interest&mdash;for Traherne, in painting the character of a magnanimous man,
was, whether consciously or unconsciously, drawing his own portrait.
Flattering as the picture may seem, I do not doubt in the least that it
is a true one.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Magnanimity and contentment are very near allied; like brothers
and sisters they spring from the same parents, but are of several
features. Fortitude and Patience are kindred to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lvi" id="Page_lvi">[lvi]</a></span> this incomparable
virtue. Moralists distinguish Magnanimity and Modesty, by making the
one the desire of greater, the other of less and inferior, honours.
But in my apprehension there is more in Magnanimity. It includes
all that belongs to a Great Soul: a high and mighty courage, an
invincible Patience, an immoveable Grandeur which is above the reach
of injuries, a contempt of all little and feeble enjoyments, and
a certain kind of majesty that is conversant with great things;
a high and lofty frame of spirit, allied with the sweetness of
Courtesy and Respect; a deep and stable resolution founded on
humility without any baseness; an infinite hope and a vast desire;
a Divine, profound, uncontrollable sense of one's own capacity; a
generous confidence, and a great inclination to heroical deeds; all
these conspire to complete it, with a severe and mighty expectation
of Bliss incomprehensible. It soars up to Heaven, and looks down
upon all dominion of fortune with pity and disdain. Its aims and
designs are transcendent to all concerns of this little world.
Its objects and its ends are worthy of a soul that is like God in
Nature; and nothing less than the Kingdom of God, his Life and
Image; nothing beneath the friendship and communion with Him can be
its satisfaction. The terrors, allurements, and censures of men are
the dust of its feet: their avarice and ambition are but feebleness
before it. Their riches and contentions, and interests and honours,
but insignificant and empty trifles. All the world is but a little
bubble; Infinity and Eternity the only great and sovereign things
wherewith it converseth. A Magnanimous Soul is always awake. The
whole globe of the earth is but a nutshell in comparison of its
enjoyments. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lvii" id="Page_lvii">[lvii]</a></span> sun is its lamp, the sea its fishpond, the stars
its jewels, men, angels, its attendants, and God alone its sovereign
delight and supreme complacency. The earth is its garden, all
palaces its summer houses, cities are its cottages, empires its more
spacious Courts, all ages and kingdoms its demeans, monarchs its
ministers and public agents, the whole Catholick Church its family,
the Eternal Son of God its pattern and example. Nothing is great if
compared to a Magnanimous Soul but the sovereign Lord of all Worlds.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If you would have the character of a Magnanimous Soul, he is the son
of Eternal Power, and the friend of Infinite Goodness, a Temple of
Divine and Heavenly Wisdom, that is not imposed upon by the foul and
ragged disguises of Nature, but acquainted with her great capacities
and principles, more than commonly sensible of her interests, and
depths, and desires. He is one that has gone in unto Felicity,
and enjoyed her beauties, and comes out again her perfect Lover
and Champion: a man whose inward stature is miraculous; and his
complexion so divine that he is king of as many kingdoms as he will
look on: one that scorns the smutty way of enjoying things like a
slave, because he delights in the celestial way, and the Image of
God. He knows that all the world lies in wickedness; and admires not
at all that things palpable and near and natural, are unseen, though
most powerful and glorious, because men are blind and stupid. He
pities poor vicious kings that are oppressed with heavy crowns of
vanity and gold, and admires how they can content themselves with
such narrow territories: yet delights in their regiment of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lviii" id="Page_lviii">[lviii]</a></span>
world, and pays them the honour that is due unto them. The glorious
exaltation of good kings he more abundantly extols, because so
many thousand Magnanimous Creatures are committed to their trust,
and they that govern them understand their value. But he sees
well enough that the king's glory and true repose consists in the
Catholick and Eternal kingdom. As for himself he <i>is come unto Mount
Sion, and to the City of the Living God, the Heavenly Jerusalem, and
to an innumerable company of Angels, to the General Assembly and
Church of the Firstborn, which are written in Heaven, and to God
the Judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect, and
to Jesus the Mediator of the New Covenant</i>: and therefore receiving
a Kingdom which cannot be moved, he desires to serve God acceptably
with reverence and godly fear: and the truth is we can fear nothing
else, for God alone is a consuming fire.</p></blockquote>

<p>The above passage is a fairly representative one. If the reader is
pleased with it, he would be equally pleased with the whole work; if he
sees nothing to admire in it, he may conclude that "Christian Ethicks"
is not a book which has any message in it for him.</p>

<p>The following extract is taken from the chapter "Of Charity to our
Neighbours":</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That which yet further commendeth this virtue of love unto us
is that it is the only soul of all pleasure and felicity in all
estates. It is like the light of the sun, in all the kingdoms and
houses and eyes and ages, in Heaven, in earth, in the sea, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lix" id="Page_lix">[lix]</a></span> shops
and temples, in schools and markets, in labours and recreations,
in theatres and fable. It is <i>the great demon of the world</i>, and
the sole cause of all operations. It is evidently impossible for
any fancy, or play, or romance, or fable to be composed well and
made delightful without a mixture of Love in the composure. In
all theatres and feasts and weddings and triumphs and coronations
Love is the Soul and Perfection of all. In all persons, in all
occupations, in all diversions, in all labours, in all virtues, in
all vices, in all occasions, in all families, in all cities and
empires, in all our devotions and religious actions, Love is all in
all. All the sweetness of society is seated in Love, the life of
music and dancing is Love; the happiness of houses, the enjoyment
of friends, the amity of relations, the providence of kings, the
allegiance of subjects, the glory of empires, the security, peace,
and welfare of the world is seated in Love. Without Love all is
discord and confusion. All blessings come upon us by Love, and by
Love alone all delights and blessings are enjoyed. All happiness
is established by Love, and by Love alone is Glory attained. God
knoweth that Love uniteth Souls, maketh men of one heart in a house,
fills them with liberality and kindness to each other, makes them
delightful in presence, faithful in absence, tender of the honour
and welfare of the beloved, apt to obey, ready to please, constant
in trials, patient in sufferings, courageous in assaults, prudent
in difficulties, victorious and triumphant. All that I shall need
to observe further is that it <i>completed the Joys of Heaven</i>. Well,
therefore, may wisdom desire Love, well may the Goodness of God
delight in Love. It is the sum and glory of his Eternal Kingdom.</p></blockquote>

<p>The following spirited, vigorous, and eloquent passage is from the
chapter "Of Courage":</p>

<blockquote>

<p>What a glorious and incomparable virtue this is appeareth from the
baseness and ineptitude of its contrary. A coward and an honest man
can never be the same; a coward and a constant lover can never be
the same; cowardice and wisdom are as incompatible for ever as Love
and Wisdom were thought to be of old. A coward is always despicable
and wretched, because he dares not expose himself to any hazards,
nor adventure upon any great attempt for fear of some little pain
and damage that is between him and an excellent achievement. He is
baffled from the acquisition of the most great and beautiful things,
and nonplust with every impediment. He is conquered before he begins
to fight. The very sight of danger makes him a slave. He is undone
when he sees his enemy afar off, and wounded before the point of his
sword can touch his shadow. He is all ways a terror and burden to
himself, a dangerous knave, and a useless creature.</p>

<p>Strange is the vigour in a brave man's soul. The strength of his
spirit and his irresistible power, the greatness of his heart and
the height of his condition, his mighty confidence and contempt
of dangers, his true security and repose in himself, his liberty
to dare and do what he pleaseth, his alacrity in the midst of
fears, his invincible temper, are advantages which make him master
of fortune. His courage fits him for all attempts, makes him
serviceable to God and man, and makes him the bulwark and defence of
his being and country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxi" id="Page_lxi">[lxi]</a></span></p>

<p>Let those debauched and unreasonable men that deny the existence
of virtue contemplate the reality of its excellency here, and be
confounded with shame at their prodigious blindness. Their impiety
designs the abolishment of Religion, and the utter extirpation of
all faith, and piety, while they pretend the distinction between
virtue and vice to be merely feigned for the aweing of the world,
and that their names have no foundation in Nature but the craft of
politicians and the traditions of their nurses. Are there no base
fellows, nor brave men in the world? Is there no difference between
a Lion and a Hare? a faint-hearted Coward and a glorious Hero? Is
there nothing brave nor vile in the world? What is become of these
Rodomontadoes wits? Where is the boasted glory of their personal
valour, if there be no difference, but courage and cowardice be the
same thing?</p></blockquote>

<p>I have marked, I find, at least twenty other passages for quotation;
and indeed it would be easy to extract from the book enough notable
sayings to form a pocket volume of religious and moral philosophy; but
I must content myself with only one other quotation. It is from the
chapter "Of Knowledge":</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The sun is a glorious creature, and its beams extend to the utmost
stars; by shining on them it clothes them with light, and by its
rays exciteth all their influences. It enlightens the eyes of all
the creatures: it shineth on forty kingdoms at the same time, on
seas and continents in a general manner; yet so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxii" id="Page_lxii">[lxii]</a></span> particularly
regardeth all, that every mote in the air, every grain of dust,
every spire of grass is wholly illuminated thereby as if it did
entirely shine upon that alone. Nor does it only illuminate all
these objects in an idle manner; its beams are operative, enter in,
fill the pores of things with spirits, and impregnate them with
powers, cause all their emanations, odors, virtues, and operations;
springs, rivers, minerals and vegetables are all perfected by the
sun; all the motion, life and sense of birds, beasts and fishes
dependeth on the same. Yet the sun is but a little spark among all
the creatures that are made for the Soul; the Soul, being the most
high and noble of all, is capable of far higher perfections, far
more full of life and vigour in its uses. The sphere of its activity
is illimited, its energy is endless upon all its objects. It can
exceed the heavens in its operations, and run out into infinite
spaces. Such is the extent of knowledge that it seemeth to be the
Light of all Eternity. All objects are equally near to the splendour
of its beams: As innumerable millions may be conceived in its
Light, with a ready capacity for millions more; so can it penetrate
all abysses, reach to the centre of all Nature, converse with all
beings, visible and invisible, corporeal and spiritual, temporal and
eternal, created and increated, finite and infinite, substantial
and accidental, actual and possible, imaginary and real; all the
mysteries of bliss and misery, all the secrets of heaven and hell
are objects of the Soul's capacity, and shall be actually seen and
known here.</p></blockquote>

<p>It seems strange indeed that no compiler in search of material for a
book of selections, no student in search of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxiii" id="Page_lxiii">[lxiii]</a></span> forgotten excellence, no
seeker for wisdom conjoined with piety, has ever lighted in his search
upon "Christian Ethicks." But it came into the world in a time of
general dissoluteness of manners, and amid the jarrings of contending
sects and the venomous contests of political parties. Probably very
few copies of the book were sold, and its rarity in after times has
prevented it from becoming known to any one who had the will and the
power to proclaim its merits.</p>

<p>"Poetry," says Milton, if he be indeed the author of "Nova Solyma," "is
the impetuous rush of a mind full to overflowing, strained, exalted to
its utmost powers, yea, rather, lifted into ecstacy beyond itself."<a name="FNanchor_C_C" id="FNanchor_C_C"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_C" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>
Could we accept this (as we cannot) as a complete definition of the
poetic faculty, we might then place Traherne in the very front rank of
inspired singers. It would be impossible to give a better description
of the leading characteristics of his poetry than that which we find
in the words of Milton. Not Milton himself, nor even Shelley, has more
of the impetuous rush of a mind lifted into ecstacy beyond itself
than Traherne. No poet writes with more absolute spontaneity than he.
Whatever may be wanting in him, however he may occasionally fail in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxiv" id="Page_lxiv">[lxiv]</a></span>
expression, he has always this impetuous rush, this ecstacy that rises
beyond itself. A glowing ardour of conviction, a passionate spirit
of love and devotion, a profound sense of the beauty and sublimity
which he saw everywhere around him, a never-failing aspiration towards
that Goodness which he believed to be the Fountain and the Ocean, the
Beginning and the End of Things, were the sources of his inspiration,
the impelling forces of his genius. Where these qualities are present
their possessor can never altogether fail in expressing them, however
deficient he may be in the technical accomplishments of the poet's art.
These things indeed are the root, if not the flower, of all poetry
worthy of the name. That Traherne was essentially a poet we might
be certain even if none of his lyrical work had remained to prove
it. The man who could say, "You never enjoy the world aright till
the sea itself floweth in your veins, till you are clothed with the
heavens, and crowned with the stars"&mdash;a sentence which contains the
essence of everything that has been said by the poets who have sung
of the relation between the soul of man and the spirit of Nature&mdash;did
not need to write in verse in order to prove that he was beyond all
question a poet. There is enough of the spirit of poetry in "Christian
Ethicks" and "Centuries of Meditations" to set up a dozen versifiers.
It was as impossible for Traherne to see things as a Jeremy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxv" id="Page_lxv">[lxv]</a></span> Bentham
or a Cobbett saw them, as it was for either or the latter to have
written the sentence I have just quoted. And who shall say that the
light of imagination through which Traherne and those who resemble
him behold the universe is a light which misleads them? Why should we
assume that those who view it with eyes that are blind to all but its
prosaic aspects are its true interpreters? Whatever else it may be, the
universe, it is certain, is a marvellous and stupendous poem; and it is
singular indeed if those who are insensible to this truth are able to
see it in a clearer light than those who are alive to all its beauty,
to all its magnificence, and to all its mystery.</p>

<p>With Traherne poetry was no elegant recreation, no medium for the
display of a lively fancy, no means of exhibiting his skill as a
master of metrical effects, but the vehicle through which he expressed
his deepest convictions and his profoundest thoughts. He used it as
a gift which it was his duty to employ only for the highest purposes
and the most sacred ends. All that he saw, felt, and apprehended was
transmuted by the alchemy of his mind into that mysterious union of
thought, imagination, and expression, which we half praise and half
disparage when we term it poetic inspiration. He possessed&mdash;or rather
was possessed by&mdash;that "fine madness" without which no poet, painter,
or musician ever yet created a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxvi" id="Page_lxvi">[lxvi]</a></span> work which deserved to outlive its
author. He saw in the universe no "foul and pestilent congregation of
vapours," but a majestic dwelling-place for gods, angels, and men. All
nature to him was lovely and perfect; and if the existence of evil,
injustice, and sin disquieted him for a moment he had little difficulty
in persuading himself that these things were owing not to defect or
imperfection in nature, but to the folly or perverseness of men in
departing from it. It may indeed be said of him, as Matthew Arnold said
of Wordsworth, that his eyes refused to dwell upon the darker aspects
of life and nature; but that, in his case, as in Wordsworth's, was in
a great degree the source of his greatness, and is the reason why he
interests us. It is only those that possess an undoubting faith who can
inspire it in others. It is given only to a Shakespeare or a Goethe
to "see life steadily and see it whole." Almost all other authors see
it, as their nature prompts them, in colours which are either too
glowing or too sombre. It has been said of the author of "The City of
Dreadful Night" that he was born that we might have things stated at
their worst, once for all:<a name="FNanchor_D_D" id="FNanchor_D_D"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_D" class="fnanchor">[D]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxvii" id="Page_lxvii">[lxvii]</a></span> may we not likewise say of Traherne that
he was born that things might be stated, once for all, at their best?
Perhaps the reader may think that his poems do not justify so strong
a claim; but when they are taken in conjunction with his "Christian
Ethicks" and "Centuries of Meditations" I do not think it can be
considered as an overstatement. Whether his moral and theological views
were right or wrong, Traherne at least was warranted in holding them,
because they were exactly suited to his peculiar temperament, if indeed
they were not the outcome of it. Were all men blessed with so happy a
disposition as his, then indeed might the world become the Eden which
to him it appeared to be. He believed that all men might be as happy as
he was if they would only firmly resolve to follow the path which had
led him to felicity. Like all enthusiasts and most reformers of human
nature or human institutions, he made the mistake of supposing that
others were, or might be made, like-minded with himself, and did not
take into account the infinite varieties of character and temperament
which exist among mankind. But to believe that men are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxviii" id="Page_lxviii">[lxviii]</a></span> better and
nobler is at least a less fault than to believe them to be worse and
baser than they are.</p>


<p>To claim for Traherne a place in the front rank of poets is hardly
possible. Considering his limited range of subjects, we cannot put him
on an equality with the poets who have exhibited more varied powers,
and shown a deeper insight into human nature. But, excluding Milton,
we may at least place him in the front rank of poets of his class.
It is possible my opinion may be somewhat biassed by a reason which
the reader will be at no loss to divine; but I cannot help thinking
that neither Herbert, Crashaw, nor Vaughan can compare with Traherne
in the most essential qualities of the poet. He alone has that
"impetuous rush of a mind ... lifted into ecstasy beyond itself" which
Milton, as we have seen, regarded as the chief requisite of poetry.
Herbert has a finer sense of proportion, a keener perception of the
importance of form and measure; Vaughan appeals more strongly to the
common sympathies of mankind; while Crashaw, when at his best, has
more fine passages of quintessential poetry, more curious felicities
of expression, than Traherne; but none of them has the vitality, the
sustained enthusiasm, the power imparted by intense conviction, which
we find in our author. Vitality, indeed, seems to me to be the keynote
of Traherne's character. That he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxix" id="Page_lxix">[lxix]</a></span> himself aware of this we may see
from his poem on Contentment:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div>Employment is the very life and ground</div>
      <div>Of life itself; whose pleasant motion is</div>
      <div class="i2">The form of Bliss:</div>
      <div>All Blessedness a life with Glory crown'd;</div>
      <div>Life! Life is all: in its most full extent</div>
      <div>Stretcht out to all things, and with all Content.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Not, be it observed, the still life of contemplation or inaction, but
an active, eager, energetic enjoying of life, to be so used as to
get from it the utmost degree of felicity or blessedness. Traherne
repudiates energetically the idea that the more unhappy we make
ourselves here the greater will be our happiness hereafter. In his
"Centuries of Meditations" he says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There are Christians that place and desire all their happiness in
another life, and there is another sort of Christians that desire
happiness in this. The one can defer their enjoyment of wisdom to
the world to come, and dispense with the increase and perfection of
enjoyment for a little time; the other are instant and impatient of
delay, and would fain see that happiness here which they shall enjoy
hereafter.... Whether the first sort be Christians indeed, look you
to that. They have much to say for themselves. Yet certainly they
that put off Felicity with long delays are to be much suspected. For
it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxx" id="Page_lxx">[lxx]</a></span> is against the nature of love and desire to defer, nor can any
reason be given why they should desire it at last, and not now.</p></blockquote>

<p>While we may not claim for Traherne's work as a whole that it is of
the first order of excellence, we may, I think, make that claim for
some of it. We can hardly have a better test of a poet's merits than
to inquire how many of his pieces are fit to take their place in such
anthologies as the "Golden Treasury," or Mr. Quiller-Couch's "Oxford
Book of English Verse." Judged in this way Traherne makes, I think, a
very good showing, considering (as I have elsewhere explained) that
we possess only a part of his poetical works, and that what we have
had probably not received his final revision. Were I asked to name
the pieces which, in my opinion, deserve the honour which I have
mentioned, I think my first choice would fall upon "The Salutation,"
"Wonder," "The Approach," "The Circulation," "Desire," "Goodness," and
"On News."<a name="FNanchor_E_E" id="FNanchor_E_E"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_E" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> I am not at all sure, however, that this is the best
selection that could be made. "Innocence," "The Rapture," "Silence,"
"The Choice," "The Person," "The Recovery," "Love," and "Thoughts&mdash;I.
and II." have perhaps equal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxi" id="Page_lxxi">[lxxi]</a></span> or almost equal claims to be included in
a list of Traherne's best work. But individual tastes differ so much
that I daresay other readers would make another choice, for Traherne is
a remarkably equal writer, and does not often fall below his own level
of excellence. Yet all the poems I have mentioned, fine as they are
when standing alone, gain considerably when they are read as parts of
a continuous poem, the subject of which is the history of the author's
progress in his pilgrimage towards the kingdom of perfect Blessedness.
He too, like Bunyan's pilgrim, found difficulties and dangers in the
way; but with him it was rather a triumphant progress from victory
to victory than a long and bitter struggle against enemies who might
at any time have overcome him. Very few of his poems dwell upon his
discouragements; most of them are songs of rejoicing for victories
achieved or happiness attained.</p>

<p>In the last analysis it will always be found that it is the poet
himself and not his poetry that has the greatest interest for us.
Unless he is interesting in himself he will not interest us in his
writings. No amount of study and pains will suffice to render the work
of a shallow and commonplace personality interesting to us. From the
strong only shall sweetnesss come forth. I do not know whether I have
succeeded in any degree in convincing the reader that Traherne was,
both as a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxii" id="Page_lxxii">[lxxii]</a></span> and as a poet, a very interesting character; but if I
have not, the fault assuredly is mine, and not his. We may study him in
two aspects: firstly, as a representative of the poetic temperament;
and secondly, as a representative of the religious idiosyncrasy in
conjunction with the poetic&mdash;for religion in many of its professors is
often enough altogether disjoined from any tincture of poetry. In both
aspects we have ample materials for studying him: and I cannot help
thinking that few writers of his age are better worth studying.</p>

<p>Were Traherne a smaller man than he is, and therefore less able to
afford to have the whole truth told about him, I should hesitate long
before printing the following remarks on some of his shortcomings.
It is the less needful to attempt to conceal his defects, since they
are for the greater part the defects of his qualities, and therefore
inseparable from them. Constituted as he was, it was not possible
for him to see things in a wholly clear and uncoloured light. He is
elevated so high above ordinary humanity that he is unable to see
clearly what is so much beneath him. Nor is it always easy for us,
the dwellers upon the plain, to ascend to his altitude. He is so
exempt from the ordinary failings of humanity that we feel almost as
if he belonged to a different race. He died a bachelor, and I do not
find anything in his writings which shows that he ever experienced
the passion of love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxiii" id="Page_lxxiii">[lxxiii]</a></span> in relation to the female sex. His love for the
divine seems to have swallowed up all thought of sexual love, though
not his love for humanity in the mass. He is sometimes so mystical or
metaphysical that the ordinary reader finds it difficult to comprehend
him. But, after all, if the reader will only exercise a little patience
and be at the expense of a little thought, he will not find it hard to
understand the poet, even in his most difficult passages. Those who are
able to follow Browning through all his intricacies will find no knot
in Traherne which they will not easily unravel.</p>

<p>The charge which is most likely to be pressed against Traherne is that
he appears to have been a man of few ideas, and is consequently much
given to repetition of thoughts and even of words and phrases. That
there is some foundation for this charge may be admitted, but it is
nevertheless unjust. No one, after the examination of his manuscripts
and of his two published works, could believe it. A scholar so well
versed in the classics, a student so eager for knowledge of all kinds,
a thinker so acute, could not possibly be a man of narrow ideas and
restricted sympathies. What is true, however, is that his mind dwelt
with so much delight upon certain thoughts that it was continually
recurring to them, setting them in different lights, and repeating
them, even as a musician will execute ever-new variations upon a
favourite theme.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxiv" id="Page_lxxiv">[lxxiv]</a></span> Those who care for Traherne's themes will not
complain that he dwells too much upon them.</p>

<p>It must be owned, I think, that while Traherne is usually happy in
the selection of his themes, he is sometimes less happy in developing
and expressing them. Lines which leave something to be desired in
smoothness (though he is not usually chargeable with this fault, his
handling of the heroic couplet being particularly good), and now and
then lines which to our modern ideas appear to be somewhat prosaic,
are certainly to be found in his poems, and do, to a small extent,
interfere with the reader's pleasure in them. But for such faults as
these we ought surely to make large allowance. The reader should,
and doubtless will, remember that he has before him a work for which
the author himself has but a limited responsibility. Had he himself
published the poems we should have been entitled to think that he
deliberately chose to give them to the world with all their faults upon
them. As it is, I think we may assume that had he lived to publish them
they would have undergone a good deal of revision before they were sent
forth to the world. Most of their defects are such as might be easily
remedied, and such, indeed, as it was sometimes hard to refrain from
remedying. But I have resisted all such temptations, and have confined
myself to the task of making the printed text as nearly as possible
a reproduction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxv" id="Page_lxxv">[lxxv]</a></span> of the original manuscripts. The reader will gather
from the facsimile of one of Traherne's poems, which I have given as a
frontispiece to this volume, a good general idea as to the character
of his handwriting, his spelling, and his punctuation. It would have
been an interesting thing could the whole of Traherne's poems have been
reproduced in the same style, for, as the reader will see, there is a
picturesqueness, a beauty, and a life about the manuscripts which is
lost in the cold regularity of type. Some readers may perhaps think
that it would have been better to follow the author's original spelling
and punctuation; but after giving full consideration to this point, it
did not seem advisable to do this. Traherne's spelling is by no means
uniform&mdash;Deity, for instance, is sometimes "Dietie" and sometimes
"Deitie"&mdash;and his punctuation, which is, I think, quite peculiar to
himself, differs so much from our modern practice, that if it had
been reproduced without modification it would often have obscured his
meaning and puzzled the reader without any compensating advantage.</p>

<p>Traherne, as will be perceived from the frontispiece, made much use of
capital letters and occasionally of italics in his writings. This was
the custom of the time, as any one who examines a seventeenth-century
printed book will see. In the first edition of this book I preserved
most of the author's capitals and italicised passages: but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxvi" id="Page_lxxvi">[lxxvi]</a></span> here I have
thought it unnecessary to do so. Upon the whole there seemed to be
no advantage in retaining them, since they look a little odd to eyes
accustomed to the uniformity of modern typography. In the case of the
poems taken from "Christian Ethicks," however, I have preserved the old
spelling and the capitals very nearly as they appear in the book.</p>

<p>Traherne, so far as English authors were concerned, was very little
indebted to his predecessors. He was, of course, greatly influenced by
the writers of the Old and New Testaments, from whom he is continually
quoting in his "Christian Ethicks." Next to the Scriptures, the book
which seems most to have influenced him was that ancient mystical and
philosophical work which is attributed to Hermes Trismegistus. Those
who are well acquainted with that remarkable production will find
frequent traces of its influence in the prose and verse of Traherne.
He gives several extracts from it in "Christian Ethicks," and in his
"Commonplace Book" there are continual references to it. It might
almost be said that, after the Bible, it was his chief manual of
philosophy and of divine wisdom.</p>

<p>That Traherne was well acquainted with the writings of Herbert is
evident from the fact that in one of his manuscript books he has copied
out that writer's poem, "To all Angels and Saints"; but I do not find
any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxvii" id="Page_lxxvii">[lxxvii]</a></span> traces of Herbert's influence upon him either in prose or verse.
Nor do I find any proof that he was acquainted with the writings of
Vaughan. The resemblance between Traherne's line,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div>How, like an Angel came I down,</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="p-left">and Vaughan's reference to his "angel infancy" is probably no more than
an accidental coincidence. Though their points of view were similar
in many respects, Traherne possessed a much stronger personality than
Vaughan, and therefore had little or nothing to learn from him. It is
likely enough that he owed something to Donne, as most of the poets of
his time did; but I do not find any clear indications of that poet's
influence in his writings. Traherne's style, indeed, is that of his
age, but as to his matter, few poets, I think, can boast of more
originality.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most remarkable thing about Traherne's poetry is that it
anticipates so much that seems to belong to much later periods of
our literary history. Traherne, indeed, is likely to suffer to some
extent in his reputation because ideas which with him were certainly
original&mdash;or at least as much so as any ideas in any poets can be said
to be original&mdash;have since become commonplaces in our literature. The
praise of the beauty and innocence of childhood is familiar enough to
us now, and has, perhaps, in some instances been carried to a rather
ridiculous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxviii" id="Page_lxxviii">[lxxviii]</a></span> extreme. That certainly was not the case in Traherne's
time. So far as I know, he was the first who dwelt upon those ideas in
any other than an incidental and allusive manner. It is true that we
find in Vaughan some passages of a similar tendency, but they are few
and slight in comparison with those which we find in Traherne. If there
are similar passages in other poets previous to, or contemporary with,
the latter, I must confess that I am unacquainted with them. Nor were
the poetical possibilities of the theme discovered until more than a
century afterwards, when William Blake, who by the light of genius&mdash;or
shall we say lunacy?&mdash;discovered so much else, discovered them. It was
fitting, indeed, that Blake, whose youthful experiences seem to have
more nearly resembled Traherne's than those of any other poet, should
have followed all unknowingly in the elder writer's footsteps. Had
he ever sat down to record the events of his infancy and childhood,
Blake's narrative, I think, however different in detail, must have been
like that of his predecessor in its chief features. I do not believe
that there is any point out of all those which I have quoted respecting
Traherne's childhood which Blake might not also have recorded of
himself. Much as they differed in matters of faith, there was a deep
and fundamental agreement in character and temperament between the two
poets. To both of them the things seen by their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxix" id="Page_lxxix">[lxxix]</a></span> imaginations were more
real than the things seen with the eye, and to neither of them was
there any dividing line between the natural and the supernatural. Their
faiths were founded upon intuition rather than reason, and they were no
more troubled by doubt or disbelief than a mountain is. Their capacity
for faith was infinite, and stopped short only when their imagination
failed them&mdash;if it ever did fail them.</p>

<p>Another poet with whom Traherne has some remarkable affinities is
Wordsworth&mdash;not the Wordsworth of later life, when his poetic vein,
if not exhausted, had at least grown thin and unproductive, but the
Wordsworth of the magnificent ode "Intimations of Immortality from
Recollections of Early Childhood." Let the reader once more peruse
that poem, and note carefully the leading points in it. Then let him,
bearing in mind the foregoing extracts from Traherne's "Centuries of
Meditations," go carefully through the various poems in which the
earlier poet celebrates the happiness of his infancy and childhood.
When he has done this, let him ask himself if he would have believed
that Wordsworth was unacquainted with Traherne's writings, supposing
that they had been published before the later poet's time? I cannot
think myself that it would have been easy in that case to think that
the modern poet was entirely unindebted to the older one. It is
hardly too much to say<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxx" id="Page_lxxx">[lxxx]</a></span> that there is not a thought of any value in
Wordsworth's Ode which is not to be found in substance in Traherne.
Of course, I do not say this with any view of disparaging Wordsworth,
whose Ode, even if it had been, as we know it was not, derived from
Traherne, would still have been a masterpiece. Its merit, like that
of Gray's "Elegy," depends at least as much upon its form as upon its
substance, and that, of course, was all Wordsworth's own. It is in a
measure a testimony to the authentic character of their inspiration
when two poets, unknown to each other, produce works which are so
nearly identical in substance and spirit.</p>

<p>The reader will remember that Traherne in his youth determined to
follow the bent of his own inclination at whatever cost of poverty
or want of worldly success. That was the case also with Wordsworth.
Another point in which, as it seems to me, they resembled each other
was in the matter of poetic style. At first sight, indeed, there does
not appear to be any likeness between them in this respect; yet,
allowing for the difference in their times and their temperaments, I
think we may find a good deal of similarity. Traherne's style, allowing
for the nature of his subjects, is always simple and direct. His aim
is to affect the minds of his readers by the weight of his thought and
the enthusiasm of his utterance, not to astonish them by far-fetched
metaphors or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxi" id="Page_lxxxi">[lxxxi]</a></span> delight them with dulcet melodies. He has no ornament
for ornament's sake, and he never attempts to clothe his "naked simple
thought" in silken raiment or cloth of gold. He does not indulge in the
metaphysical conceits and ingenuities with which the works of Donne and
Cowley are so plentifully besprinkled. "Poetic diction" was as little
sought for by him as by Wordsworth. He did not, however, fall into
the error that Wordsworth sometimes did, of mistaking puerility for
simplicity. I do not wish to press this point too far. I only desire
to show that both poets were more solicitous about the substance than
the form of their poetry. Wordsworth would have heartily endorsed the
doctrine of Traherne that the best things are the commonest, and that
natural objects and not artificial inventions are the true well-springs
of delight.</p>

<p>Though the reader will, I hope, have agreed with my contention that
Traherne anticipated a good many poetical ideas which have been thought
to belong to much later dates, I can hardly expect him to accept
without demur the claim I am now about to make on the poet's behalf.
That Traherne had a considerable genius for metaphysics will be evident
to any one who reads his "Christian Ethicks," or who studies at all
carefully the contents of the present volume. But to claim that he was
the originator of the metaphysical system<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxii" id="Page_lxxxii">[lxxxii]</a></span> which, since it was first
made known, has created more discussion and exercised more influence
than any other has done, will probably seem at first to be a very
extravagant assertion. Yet that he had at least a clear prevision of
that famous system which is known as the Berkeleian philosophy is, I
think, incontestable. That theory, it seems to me, could hardly be
stated in a clearer or more precise manner than it is in Traherne's
poem entitled "My Spirit." I am much mistaken if the theory of
"the non-existence of independent matter," which is the essence of
Berkeley's system, is not to be found in this poem&mdash;not, it is true,
stated as a philosophical dogma, but yet clearly implied, and not
merely introduced as a flight of poetical fancy. It seems to me that
if the following stanza from that poem is not altogether meaningless,
no other construction can be placed upon it than that its author was a
Berkeleian before Berkeley was born:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div>This made me present evermore</div>
      <div class="i1">With whatsoe'er I saw.</div>
      <div>An object, if it were before</div>
      <div>My eyes, was by Dame Nature's law</div>
      <div class="i1"></div>
      <div>Within my soul. Her store</div>
      <div>Was all at once within me: all Her treasures</div>
      <div>Were my immediate and internal pleasures,</div>
      <div>Substantial joys which did inform my Mind.</div>
      <div class="i2">With all She wrought</div>
      <div class="i2">My Soul was fraught</div>
      <div>And every object in my Heart a Thought</div>
      <div class="i1">Begot or was; I could not tell</div>
      <div class="i2">Whether the things did there</div>
      <div class="i3">Themselves appear,</div>
      <div>Which in my Spirit truly seem'd to dwell;</div>
      <div class="i1"><i>Or whether my conforming Mind</i></div>
      <div class="i1"><i>Were not even all that therein shin'd</i>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The idea that matter has no existence, apart from its existence in the
Spirit of the Eternal, or in the soul of man, is surely clearly, if
not positively, advanced in the last six lines of the above stanza.
The thought, so strangely fascinating to a poet&mdash;and Berkeley no
less than Traherne was one&mdash;that the whole exterior universe is not
really a thing apart from and independent of man's consciousness of
it, but something which exists only as it is perceived, is undeniably
to be found in "My Spirit." I have quoted only one stanza of it, but
the whole poem should be carefully studied, for it is throughout an
assertion of the supremacy of mind over matter, and an averment that it
is the former and not the latter which has a real existence. If it be
thought that it is going too far to say that the Berkeleian system is
to be found in the poem&mdash;which of course it is not as a reasoned-out
and complete theory&mdash;it yet cannot be denied that it is there in germ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxiv" id="Page_lxxxiv">[lxxxiv]</a></span>
and in such a form that it only required to be seized upon by an acute
intellect to be developed in the way Berkeley developed it. That the
latter knew nothing of Traherne's poem is certain, and therefore I am
not attempting to detract in any way from the credit which belongs to
him. I am only anxious to give the poet his due as the first who caught
a glimpse of so notable a truth or error&mdash;which ever it may be.<a name="FNanchor_F_F" id="FNanchor_F_F"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_F" class="fnanchor">[F]</a></p>

<p>Deeply as Traherne was penetrated with a sense of the glory of the
universe, and of the infinite greatness of its Creator, it was with
no sense of abasement that he contemplated them. He felt that in his
own soul, so capable of the sublimest conceptions and the most exalted
aspirations, there must needs be a divine element. He was no outcast
thrust out of Eden into a wilderness of spiritual destitution, but the
son of a loving Father, born to a splendid inheritance, and at least
as necessary to the Deity as servants and dependents are to keep up
the state and dignity of a king. If God confers benefits on man it
is in order that He may witness man's delight in them and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxv" id="Page_lxxxv">[lxxxv]</a></span> gratitude
for them. To see this is a supreme delight to Him, and without it
there would be something wanting to His felicity. But I must quote a
stanza from "The Recovery," lest the reader should think that I am
misrepresenting the poet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="i2">For God enjoy'd is all His End.</div>
      <div class="i2">Himself He then doth comprehend</div>
      <div class="i2">When He is blessed, magnified,</div>
      <div>Extoll'd, exalted, prais'd and glorified,</div>
      <div class="i2">Honor'd, esteem'd, belov'd, enjoy'd,</div>
      <div class="i2">Admired, sanctified, obey'd,</div>
      <div class="i3">That is received. For <i>He</i></div>
      <div class="i2">Doth place His whole Felicity</div>
      <div>In that, <i>who is despised and defied,</i></div>
      <div><i>Undeified almost if once denied</i>.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Matthew Arnold said of Goethe that he</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div>Neither made man too much a God</div>
      <div class="i1">Nor God too much a man.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>That could hardly be said of Traherne. It is scarcely possible, I
think, to deny that in the above-quoted passage he committed the fault
of making "God too much a man." That, however, was a fault which he
shared with most of the theologians of his time. Perhaps it is a fault
which is almost inseparable from a sincere and fervent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxvi" id="Page_lxxxvi">[lxxxvi]</a></span> faith. Without
refining away the conception of God to a mere abstraction, it is
impossible to think of Him otherwise than as an infinitely magnified
and glorified man. Since the human mind is so constituted, it is surely
vain to attempt to set limits within which we are to think of Him.
Every man will do this according to the law of his own temperament.
The man of cool reason and well-controlled passions will form a
very different conception of the Deity from the man of enthusiastic
disposition and ardent emotions. To think of the Deity as "a power not
ourselves which makes for righteousness" is no more possible for a
Traherne, than it is for an Arnold to think of God as One</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="i3">who is despised and defied,</div>
      <div>Undeified almost if once denied.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>To make all men think alike, whether on political, moral, or
theological subjects, is now seen by all but a very few reactionaries
to be an impossible task. It is needless to defend Traherne for the
views he took regarding the relations between God and man; I have only
thought it expedient to show that the line he followed was that to
which he was impelled by the character of his individuality.</p>

<p>An excellent poet, a prose-writer of equal or perhaps greater
excellence, an exemplary preacher and teacher,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxvii" id="Page_lxxxvii">[lxxxvii]</a></span> who gave in his own
person an example of the virtues which he inculcated, one with whom
religion was not a garment to be put on, but the life of his life and
the spring of all his actions&mdash;such was Thomas Traherne. Much as I
dissent from his opinions, and much as my point of view as regards the
meaning and the purpose of life differs from his, I have yet found it
easy to appreciate the fineness of his character, and the charm of
his writings. It is not necessary that we should believe as Traherne
believed in order to derive benefit from his works. Men of all faiths
may study them with profit, and derive from them a new impulse towards
that "plain living and high thinking" by which alone happiness can be
reached and peace of mind assured.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It remains for me to tell the strange story of the fate of Traherne's
manuscripts after his death. They passed, we may reasonably suppose,
together with his books, into the hands of his brother Philip,
as directed in his will. Philip Traherne, I imagine, was in some
way&mdash;perhaps by marriage&mdash;connected with a family named Skipp, which
dwelt at Ledbury, in Herefordshire. These Skipps appear to have become
the owners and custodians of the poet's remains; and in their hands
they probably rested down to the year 1888, when it seems that the
property belonging to the family was dispersed. Into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxviii" id="Page_lxxxviii">[lxxxviii]</a></span> what hands the
Traherne manuscripts then fell cannot now be ascertained; but it was
certainly into hands that were ignorant of their value. In the latter
part of 1896, or the early months of 1897, some of them had descended
to the street bookstall, that last hope of books and manuscripts
in danger of being consigned to the waste-paper mills. Here, most
fortunately, two of them were discovered by my friend, Mr. William
T. Brooke, who acquired them at the price of a few pence. They could
hardly have fallen into better hands, for Mr. Brooke's knowledge of our
poetical literature, and especially of sacred poetry and hymnology,
is no less remarkable for its extent than for its exactness. As soon
as he could find time to examine the manuscripts he at once saw that
they were of great interest and value. He could hardly imagine that
writings so admirable could be the work of an unknown author; and
he at length came to the conclusion, from the fact that the poems
resembled those of Henry Vaughan in their subjects and partly in their
sentiments, that they must be his. This was an unfortunate idea, since
it caused a considerable delay in the tracing out of the real author.
Mr. Brooke communicated his discovery to the late Dr. Grosart, who
became so much interested in the matter that he purchased the two
manuscripts. He, too, after some waverings of opinion, during which
he was disposed to attribute the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_lxxxix" id="Page_lxxxix">[lxxxix]</a></span> manuscripts, first to Theophilus
Gale, and secondly to Thomas Vaughan, became convinced that they must
be Henry Vaughan's. Under this persuasion he prepared for the press
a most elaborate edition of Vaughan's works, in which the matter
contained in the manuscripts was to be included. This edition he was,
at the time of his death, endeavouring to find means to publish. That
the work thus projected was not actually published must, I think,
be regarded as a fortunate circumstance. Whether the poems, on the
authority of Dr. Grosart, would have been accepted as Vaughan's, can
only be conjectured; but it seems probable that they would, since it
is unlikely that any critic, however much he might have doubted their
imputed authorship, would have been able to trace out the real author.
An irreparable injury would thus have been inflicted upon Traherne,
while Vaughan would have received an unneeded accession of fame, at
the expense of puzzling all readers of a critical disposition by the
exhibition of inconsistent and irreconcilable qualities.</p>

<p>Upon Dr. Grosart's death his library was purchased by the well-known
bookseller, Mr. Charles Higham, of Farringdon Street. Included in it
were the two Traherne manuscript volumes. Having learned from Mr.
Brooke the story of the manuscripts, and that they were in Mr. Higham's
hands, I became interested in the matter, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xc" id="Page_xc">[xc]</a></span> ultimately purchased
them. Afterwards, when a part of Dr. Grosart's library was sold at
Sotheby's, I became the possessor of the third manuscript volume, which
their late owner appears not to have known to be Traherne's, though
nothing is needed but to compare it with the other volumes in order to
see that all three are in the same handwriting.</p>

<p>It is due to Mr. Higham to say that he most liberally allowed me to
examine the manuscripts before purchasing them, so that I might form my
own opinion as to their authorship. I need not say that I should have
been delighted if I could have come to the same conclusion that Mr.
Brooke and Dr. Grosart had arrived at. Inclination and interest alike
impelled me to take their view. But when I sat down to read the poems
and to compare them with the acknowledged writings of Henry Vaughan, I
soon began to doubt, and it required but a little time for that doubt
to develop into a conviction that whoever might have been their author,
they were assuredly not written by the Silurist. It is true that the
poems deal, as most of Vaughan's do, solely with religious or moral
subjects, and that the author dwells continually, as Vaughan did, upon
the subjects of childhood and innocence; and that both authors display
the same love of nature and of a simple and natural life. It is true
also that we find both poets making use of some rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xci" id="Page_xci">[xci]</a></span> uncommon words
and phrases, and that we find in both the same free use of defective
rhymes. These resemblances, however, are merely superficial. In all
the deeper matters of style, thought, and temperament, Traherne and
Vaughan were as far apart as any two men, animated as both were by a
deep spirit of piety and beneficence, could well be. To me, had there
been no other difference, one striking note of dissimilarity would
have sufficed to prove that the poems in manuscript and those of
Vaughan could not have proceeded from the same pen. In the manuscript
poems an ever-present quality is a passionate fervour of thought, an
intense ardour of enthusiasm, which is not to be found, or at least
only rarely, in Vaughan's works. Restrained emotion, expressed in
verse which moves slowly and not without effort, is, it seems to me,
the leading characteristic of Vaughan's poetry; emotion in full flood,
expressed in lively and energetic diction, is that of Traherne's. With
Traherne all nature is bathed in warmth and light: with Vaughan we feel
sensible of a certain coolness of temperament, and are conscious that
he rejoices rather in the twilight than in the radiance of noonday.</p>

<p>With the conviction that the poems could not be Vaughan's, while yet it
seemed unlikely that they could be the work of an altogether unknown or
unpractised writer, I began to search for indications by which their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xcii" id="Page_xcii">[xcii]</a></span>
author might possibly be discovered. Here again I found Mr. Brooke's
assistance most valuable. To an edition of Giles Fletcher's "Christ's
Victory and Triumph," which he had edited, he had appended a number of
previously uncollected seventeenth-century poems. Among these was one
entitled "The Ways of Wisdom." To this poem he now drew my attention,
as he had previously drawn Dr. Grosart's. It was at once evident to
me that its style was very similar to that of the manuscript poems.
In fact, that poem, as any reader will see who cares to study it in
comparison with the other poems in this volume, presents such strong
resemblances and parallels with them that it is hardly too much to
say that the question as to their common authorship might have been
rested entirely upon it. However, it was of course desirable to find
further evidence. Mr. Brooke told me that he had found the poem in a
little book in the British Museum, entitled "A Serious and Patheticall
Contemplation of the Mercies of God, in several most Devout and Sublime
Thanksgivings for the same."<a name="FNanchor_G_G" id="FNanchor_G_G"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_G" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> The book, Mr. Brooke also told me,
contained other pieces in verse. These I desired him to copy out. When
he had done so it at once became evident to me that the author of the
manuscript poems and of the "Devout and Sublime<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xciii" id="Page_xciii">[xciii]</a></span> Thanksgivings" must
be, beyond all doubt, one and the same person. The fact was as clearly
demonstrated to my mind as the truths of the multiplication table. That
point being settled, the next thing was to discover, if possible, who
was the author of the "Devout and Sublime Thanksgivings." That might
have remained unknown to the end of time, but for one clue which the
book luckily afforded. This was, as the reader has seen, the statement
in the "Address to the Reader" that the author was private chaplain to
Sir Orlando Bridgeman. This clue had only to be patiently followed up
to lead to the discovery of the author's name. This Mr. Brooke at last
found to be Thomas Traherne. It was from Wood's <i>Athenæ Oxonienses</i>
that the information was obtained, and from that we also learned that
Traherne was the author of two books, "Roman Forgeries" and "Christian
Ethicks." The next step was to examine these works to see if any
evidence could be found which would connect them with the author of the
manuscripts. That evidence was found in "Christian Ethicks." This was
the poem which the reader will find on p. 157. The same poem, though in
a shorter form and with a good many textual variations, appears in the
manuscript "Centuries of Meditations" (see p. 134). Here then was proof
positive that Traherne and no other was the author of the manuscripts
in my possession. Though I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xciv" id="Page_xciv">[xciv]</a></span> did not require this evidence myself, it
was fortunate it was found, since its discovery put the matter beyond
all doubt. Will the reader accuse me of undue vanity if I say that it
was with a good deal of self-satisfaction, and no little rejoicing,
that I welcomed this confirmation of the opinion which I had formed
solely upon critical grounds? One might be tempted to think that the
whole train of circumstances by which Traherne was discovered, first to
be the author of the anonymous "Thanksgivings," and through that of the
more important manuscripts, has the appearance of being something more
than the work of chance, were it not that their long concealment, their
narrow escape from entire destruction, and the fact that the verses
printed in the present volume form only a part of Traherne's poetical
works, seem to forbid us to entertain such an idea.<a name="FNanchor_H_H" id="FNanchor_H_H"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_H" class="fnanchor">[H]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xcv" id="Page_xcv">[xcv]</a></span></p>

<p>The manuscripts from which the contents of this book have been derived
are three in number. They consist of one folio and two octavo volumes.
The folio volume contains all the poems from "The Salutation" to
"Goodness" which are here printed. The same volume contains a large
number of prose essays and memoranda alphabetically arranged so as to
form a kind of commonplace book. The greater part of these are in a
handwriting which differs from Traherne's. They appear to have been
written by a friend of the poet's, since Traherne has in many cases
added remarks of his own to those in the other writer's handwriting.
I believe it was Dr. Grosart's intention to print the whole of this
material; but although it certainly has a curious interest, it does
not appear to me that it is worth while to publish it at present. Some
parts of this commonplace book appear to have been used as material for
"Christian Ethicks" and "Centuries of Meditations"; and the whole of
it, as might be expected, is more like the notes of a student than the
finished work of an essayist.</p>

<p>The second manuscript volume contains Traherne's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xcvi" id="Page_xcvi">[xcvi]</a></span> "Centuries of
Meditations," which I have already described and quoted largely from.
The third volume contains Traherne's private religious meditations,
devotions, and prayers. It is in this latter volume that the "Hymn on
St. Bartholomew's Day," a facsimile of which is given as a frontispiece
to the present volume, is found.</p>

<p>I must not conclude without thanking my friends, G. Thorn Drury and E.
V. Lucas, to both of whom I am indebted for many valuable suggestions.
I have also to thank the Rev. Canon Beeching for similar and not less
appreciated assistance. Thanks are due also to the Rev. J. C. Foster,
who drew my attention to the passage in Aubrey's "Miscellanies"
relating to Traherne's visions, and to Miss Isabel Southall, who
searched diligently, though without success, to find out the time and
place of Traherne's birth. I have already acknowledged my obligations
to Mr. W. T. Brooke, Mr. E. H. W. Dunkin, and Mr. Gordon Goodwin.</p>

      <div class="i2">This, my dear friends, this was my blessed case;</div>
      <div>For nothing spoke to me but the fair face</div>
      <div>Of Heaven and Earth, before myself could speak,</div>
      <div>I then my Bliss did, when my silence, break.</div>
      <div>My non-intelligence of human words</div>
      <div>Ten thousand pleasures unto me affords;</div>
      <div>For while I knew not what they to me said,</div>
      <div>Before their souls were into mine convey'd,</div>
      <div>Before that living vehicle of wind</div>
      <div>Could breathe into me their infected mind,</div>
      <div>Before my thoughts were leaven'd with theirs, before</div>
      <div>There any mixture was; the Holy Door,</div>
      <div>Or gate of souls was close, and mine being one</div>
      <div>Within itself to me alone was known.</div>
      <div>Then did I dwell within a world of light,</div>
      <div>Distinct and separate from all men's sight,</div>
      <div>Where I did feel strange thoughts, and such things see</div>
      <div>That were, or seem'd, only reveal'd to me,</div>
      <div>There I saw all the world enjoyed by one;</div>
      <div>There I was in the world myself alone;</div>
      <div>No business serious seemed but one; no work</div>
      <div>But one was found; and that did in me lurk.</div>
      <div class="i2">D'ye ask me what? It was with clearer eyes</div>
      <div>To see all creatures full of Deities;</div>
      <div>Especially one's self: And to admire</div>
      <div>The satisfaction of all true desire:</div>
      <div>'Twas to be pleased with all that God hath done;</div>
      <div>'Twas to enjoy even all beneath the sun:</div>
      <div>'Twas with a steady and immediate sense</div>
      <div>To feel and measure all the excellence</div>
      <div>Of things; 'twas to inherit endless treasure,</div>
      <div>And to be filled with everlasting pleasure:</div>
      <div>To reign in silence, and to sing alone,</div>
      <div>To see, love, covet, have, enjoy and praise, in one:</div>
      <div>To prize and to be ravish'd; to be true,</div>
      <div>Sincere and single in a blessed view</div>
      <div>Of all His gifts. Thus was I pent within</div>
      <div>A fort, inpregnable to any sin:</div>
      <div>Until the avenues being open laid</div>
      <div>Whole legions entered, and the forts betrayed:</div>
      <div>Before which time a pulpit in my mind,</div>
      <div>A temple and a teacher I did find,</div>
      <div>With a large text to comment on. No ear</div>
      <div>But eyes themselves were all the hearers there,</div>
      <div>And every stone, and every star a tongue,</div>
      <div>And every gale of wind a curious song.</div>
      <div>The Heavens were an oracle, and spake</div>
      <div>Divinity: the Earth did undertake</div>
      <div>The office of a priest; and I being dumb</div>
      <div>(Nothing besides was dumb), all things did come</div>
      <div>With voices and instructions; but when I</div>
      <div>Had gained a tongue, their power began to die.</div>
      <div>Mine ears let other noises in, not theirs,</div>
      <div>A noise disturbing all my songs and prayers.</div>
      <div>My foes pulled down the temple to the ground;</div>
      <div>They my adoring soul did deeply wound</div>
      <div>And casting that into a swoon, destroyed</div>
      <div>The Oracle, and all I there enjoyed:</div>
      <div>And having once inspired me with a sense</div>
      <div>Of foreign vanities, they march out thence</div>
      <div>In troops that cover and despoil my coasts,</div>
      <div>Being the invisible, most hurtful hosts.</div>
      <div class="i2"></div>
      <div>Yet the first words mine infancy did hear</div>
      <div>The things which in my dumbness did appear,</div>
      <div>Preventing all the rest, got such a root</div>
      <div>Within my heart, and stick so close unto 't,</div>
      <div>It may be trampled on, but still will grow</div>
      <div>And nutriment to soil itself will owe.</div>
      <div><i>The first Impressions are Immortal all</i>,</div>
      <div>And let mine enemies hoop, cry, roar, or call,</div>
      <div>Yet these will whisper if I will but hear,</div>
      <div>And penetrate the heart, if not the ear.</div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <div>A quiet silent person may possess</div>
      <div>All that is great or high in Blessedness.</div>
      <div>The inward work is the supreme: for all</div>
      <div>The other were occasioned by the fall.</div>
      <div>A man that seemeth idle to the view</div>
      <div>Of others, may the greatest business do.</div>
      <div>Those acts which Adam in his innocence</div>
      <div>Performed, carry all the excellence.</div>
      <div>Those outward busy acts he knew not, were</div>
      <div>But meaner matters of a lower sphere.</div>
      <div>Building of churches, giving to the poor,</div>
      <div>In dust and ashes lying on the floor,</div>
      <div>Administering of justice, preaching peace,</div>
      <div>Ploughing and toiling for a forct increase,</div>
      <div>With visiting the sick, or governing</div>
      <div>The rude and ignorant: this was a thing</div>
      <div>As then unknown. For neither ignorance</div>
      <div>Nor poverty, nor sickness did advance</div>
      <div>Their banner in the world, till sin came in.</div>
      <div>Those therefore were occasioned all by sin.</div>
      <div>The first and only work he had to do,</div>
      <div>Was in himself to feel his bliss, to view</div>
      <div>His sacred treasures, to admire, rejoice,</div>
      <div>Sing praises with a sweet and heavenly voice,</div>
      <div>See, prize, give hourly thanks within, and love,</div>
      <div>Which is the high and only work above</div>
      <div>Them all. And this at first was mine; these were</div>
      <div>My exercises of the highest sphere.</div>
      <div>To see, approve, take pleasure, and rejoice</div>
      <div>Within, is better than an empty voice.</div>
      <div>No melody in words can equal that;</div>
      <div>The sweetest organ, lute, or harp is flat</div>
      <div>And dull, compared thereto. And O that still</div>
      <div>I might admire my Father's love and skill!</div>
      <div>This is to honour, worship, and adore,</div>
      <div>This is to love Him: nay, it is far more,</div>
      <div>It is to enjoy Him, and to imitate</div>
      <div>The life and glory of His high Estate.</div>
      <div>'Tis to receive with holy reverence,</div>
      <div>To understand His gifts, and with a sense</div>
      <div>Of pure devotion and humility,</div>
      <div>To prize His works, His Love to magnify.</div>
      <div>O happy ignorance of other things</div>
      <div>Which made me present with that King of Kings!</div>
      <div>And like Him too! All spirit, life, and power,</div>
      <div>All love and joy, in His Eternal Bower,</div>
      <div>A world of innocence as then was mine,</div>
      <div>In which the joys of Paradise did shine:</div>
      <div>And while I was not here I was in Heaven,</div>
      <div>Not resting one, but every, day in seven,</div>
      <div>For ever minding with a lively sense,</div>
      <div>The universe in all its excellence.</div>
      <div>No other thoughts did intervene, to cloy,</div>
      <div>Divert, extinguish, or eclipse my joy,</div>
      <div>No other customs, new-found wants, or dreams</div>
      <div>Invented here polluted my pure streams,</div>
      <div>No aloes or drugs, no wormwood star</div>
      <div>Was seen to fall into the sea from far;</div>
      <div>No rotten soul, did like an apple near</div>
      <div>My soul approach. There's no contagion here.</div>
      <div>An unperceived donor gave all pleasures,</div>
      <div>There nothing was but I, and all my treasures.</div>
      <div>In that fair world, one only was the Friend,</div>
      <div>One golden stream, one spring, one only end.</div>
      <div>There only one did sacrifice and sing</div>
      <div>To only one Eternal Heavenly King.</div>
      <div>The union was so strait between them two,</div>
      <div>That all was either's which my soul could view:</div>
      <div>His gifts and my possessions, both our treasures;</div>
      <div>He mine, and I the ocean of His pleasures.</div>
      <div>He was an ocean of delights from Whom</div>
      <div>The living springs and golden streams did come:</div>
      <div>My bosom was an ocean into which</div>
      <div>They all did run. And me they did enrich.</div>
      <div>A vast and infinite capacity,</div>
      <div>Did make my bosom like the Deity,</div>
      <div>In whose mysterious and celestial mind</div>
      <div>All ages and all worlds together shin'd,</div>
      <div>Who tho' He nothing said did always reign,</div>
      <div>And in Himself Eternity contain.</div>
      <div>The world was more in me, than I in it.</div>
      <div>The King of Glory in my soul did sit,</div>
      <div>And to Himself in me he always gave</div>
      <div>All that He takes delight to see me have,</div>
      <div>For so my spirit was an endless Sphere,</div>
      <div>Like God Himself, and Heaven, and Earth was there.</div>

<div class="poetry-container p2">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div>That Custom is a second Nature, we</div>
      <div>Most plainly find by Nature's purity.</div>
      <div>For Nature teacheth nothing but the truth;</div>
      <div>I'm sure that mine did in my virgin youth:</div>
      <div>The very Day my Spirit did inspire,</div>
      <div>The world's fair beauty set my soul on fire.</div>
      <div>My senses were informers to my heart,</div>
      <div>The conduits of His glory, power, and art.</div>
      <div>His greatness, wisdom, goodness, I did see,</div>
      <div>His glorious Love, and His Eternitie,</div>
      <div>Almost as soon as born; and every sense</div>
      <div>Was in me like to some Intelligence.</div>
      <div>I was by nature prone and apt to love</div>
      <div>All light and beauty, both in Heaven above,</div>
      <div>And Earth beneath, prone even to admire,</div>
      <div>Adore, and praise as well as to desire.</div>
      <div>My inclinations raised me up on high,</div>
      <div>And guided me to all Infinity.</div>
      <div>A secret self I had enclosed within,</div>
      <div>That was not bounded with my clothes or skin,</div>
      <div>Or terminated with my sight, the sphere</div>
      <div>Of which was bounded with the Heavens here:</div>
      <div>But that did rather, like the subtile light,</div>
      <div>Secured from rough and raging storms by night,</div>
      <div>Break through the lanthorn's sides, and freely ray</div>
      <div>Dispersing and dilating every way:</div>
      <div>Whose steady beams too subtile for the wind,</div>
      <div>Are such that we their bounds can scarcely find.</div>
      <div>It did encompass, and possess rare things,</div>
      <div>But yet felt more, and on its angel's wings</div>
      <div>Pierced through the skies immediately, and sought</div>
      <div>For all that could beyond all worlds be thought.</div>
      <div>It did not move, nor one way go, but stood,</div>
      <div>And by dilating of itself, all good</div>
      <div>It strove to see, as if 'twere present there,</div>
      <div>Even while it present stood conversing here:</div>
      <div>And more suggested than I could discern,</div>
      <div>Or ever since by any means could learn.</div>
      <div>Vast, unaffected wonderful desires,</div>
      <div>Like inward, native, uncaus'd hidden fires,</div>
      <div>Sprang up with expectations very strange,</div>
      <div>Which into new desires did quickly change:</div>
      <div>For all I saw beyond the azure round,</div>
      <div>Was endless darkness with no beauty crown'd.</div>
      <div>Why beauty should not there, as well as here,</div>
      <div>Why goodness should not likewise there appear,</div>
      <div>Why treasures and delights should bounded be,</div>
      <div>Since there is such a wide Infinitie;</div>
      <div>These were the doubts and troubles of my Soul,</div>
      <div>By which I do perceive without control,</div>
      <div>A world of endless joys by Nature made,</div>
      <div>That needs must flourish ever, never fade.</div>
      <div>A wide, magnificent and spacious sky,</div>
      <div>So rich 'tis worthy of the Deity,</div>
      <div>Clouds here and there like winged charets flying,</div>
      <div>Flowers ever flourishing, yet always dying,</div>
      <div>A day of glory where I all things see,</div>
      <div>As 'twere enrich'd with beams of light for me,</div>
      <div>And drown'd in glorious rays of purer light,</div>
      <div>Succeeded with a black, yet glorious night;</div>
      <div>Stars sweetly shedding to my pleased sense,</div>
      <div>On all things their nocturnal influence,</div>
      <div>With secret rooms in times and ages more,</div>
      <div>Past and to come enlarging my great store:</div>
      <div>These all in order present unto me</div>
      <div>My happy eyes did in a moment see,</div>
      <div>With wonders there-too, to my Soul unknown,</div>
      <div>Till they by men and reading first were shewn.</div>
      <div>All which were made that I might ever be</div>
      <div>With some great workman, some Great Deity.</div>
      <div>But yet there were new rooms and spaces more,</div>
      <div>Beyond all these, new regions o'er and o'er,</div>
      <div>Into all which my pent-up Soul like fire</div>
      <div>Did break, surmounting all I here admire.</div>
      <div>The spaces fill'd were like a cabinet</div>
      <div>Of joys before me most distinctly set:</div>
      <div>The empty like to large and vacant room</div>
      <div>For fancy to enlarge in, and presume</div>
      <div>A space for more, remov'd, but yet adorning</div>
      <div>Those near at hand, that pleased me every morning.</div>
      <div>Here I was seated to behold new things,</div>
      <div>In the fair fabric of the King of Kings.</div>
      <div>All, all was mine. The fountain tho' not known,</div>
      <div>Yet that there must be one was plainly shewn,</div>
      <div>Which fountain of delights must needs be Love,</div>
      <div>As all the goodness of the things did prove.</div>
      <div>It shines upon me from the highest skies,</div>
      <div>And all its creatures for my sake doth prize,</div>
      <div>Of whose enjoyment I am made the end,</div>
      <div>While how the same is so I comprehend.</div>

      <div>Are hidden in our thoughts. Thoughts are the things</div>
      <div>That us affect: The honey and the stings</div>
      <div>Of all that is are seated in a thought,</div>
      <div>Even while it seemeth weak, and next to nought.</div>
      <div>The matter of all pleasure, virtue, worth,</div>
      <div>Grief, anger, hate, revenge, which words set forth,</div>
      <div>Are thoughts alone. Thoughts are the highest things,</div>
      <div>The very offspring of the King of Kings.</div>
      <div>Thoughts are a kind of strange celestial creature</div>
      <div>That when they're good, they're such in every feature.</div>
      <div>They bear the image of their Father's face,</div>
      <div>And beautify even all His dwelling-place:</div>
      <div>So nimble, volatile, and unconfined,</div>
      <div>Illimited, to which no form's assigned,</div>
      <div>So changeable, capacious, easy, free,</div>
      <div>That what itself doth please a thought may be.</div>
      <div>From nothing to infinity it turns,</div>
      <div>Even in a moment: Now like fire it burns,</div>
      <div>Now's frozen ice: Now shapes the glorious sun,</div>
      <div>Now darkness in a moment doth become.</div>
      <div>Now all at once: Now crowded in a sand,</div>
      <div>Now fills the hemisphere, and sees a land:</div>
      <div>Now on a sudden's wider than the sky,</div>
      <div>And now runs parile with the Deity.</div>
      <div>'Tis such that it may all or nothing be,</div>
      <div>And's made so active, voluble, and free</div>
      <div>Because 'tis capable of all that's good,</div>
      <div>And is the end of all when understood.</div>
      <div>A thought can clothe itself with all the treasures</div>
      <div>Of God, and be the greatest of His pleasures.</div>
      <div>It all His laws, and glorious works, and ways,</div>
      <div>And attributes and counsels, all His praise</div>
      <div>It can conceive and imitate, and give:</div>
      <div>It is the only being that doth live.</div>
      <div>'Tis capable of all perfection here,</div>
      <div>Of all His love and joy and glory there.</div>
      <div>It is the only beauty that doth shine,</div>
      <div>Most great, transcendent, heavenly, and divine.</div>
      <div>The very best or worst of things it is,</div>
      <div>The basis of all misery or bliss.</div>
      <div>Its measures and capacities are such,</div>
      <div>Their utmost measure we can never touch.</div>
      <div>Here ornament on ornament may still</div>
      <div>Be laid; beauty on beauty, skill on skill,</div>
      <div>Strength still on strength, and life itself on life,</div>
      <div>'Tis Queen of all things, and its Maker's wife.</div>
      <div>The best of thoughts is yet a thing unknown,</div>
      <div>But when 'tis perfect it is like His own:</div>
      <div>Intelligible, endless, yet a sphere</div>
      <div>Substantial too: In which all things appear,</div>
      <div>All worlds, all excellencies, senses, graces,</div>
      <div>Joys, pleasures, creatures, and the angels' faces.</div>
      <div>It shall be married ever unto all,</div>
      <div>And all embrace, tho' now it seemeth small.</div>
      <div>A thought my soul may omnipresent be,</div>
      <div>For all it toucheth which a thought can see.</div>
      <div>O that mysterious Being! Thoughts are things</div>
      <div>Which rightly used make His creatures Kings.</div>

      <div>It enters in and doth a temple find,</div>

      <div>His treasures might be all before our eyes:</div>
      <div>For minds and souls intent upon them here,</div>

      <div>And are like spheres of bliss, by love and sight,</div>
      <div>By joy, thanksgiving, praise, made infinite.</div>
      <div>O give me grace to see Thy face, and be</div>
      <div>A constant Mirror of Eternity.</div>
      <div>Let my pure soul, transformed to a thought</div>
      <div>Attend upon Thy Throne, and, as it ought,</div>
      <div>Spend all its time in feeding on Thy love,</div>
      <div>And never from Thy sacred presence move.</div>

<p>The poems in the foregoing pages are derived (as I have already
explained) from three separate MS. volumes, and from the author's
prose volume, entitled "Christian Ethicks." The bulk of them (ending
with "Goodness") are from the folio volume. The remainder&mdash;with the
exception of the three which are from the volume of "Meditations
and Devotions"&mdash;are from the prose volume entitled "Centuries of
Meditations." I have printed all the poems which I have found in these
various sources, with one exception. This is a poem which appears in
the folio volume, but which is there crossed through as though marked
for suppression.<a name="FNanchor_M_M" id="FNanchor_M_M"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_M" class="fnanchor">[M]</a> Whether this mark of suppression was made by the
author or by another person there are no means of judging; but as the
poem in question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span> is, as I think, somewhat below the level of its
companions, I have thought it better to reserve it for the appendix
than to print it between the poems "Thoughts" I. and II., where it
occurs in the MS.</p>

<p>To enable the reader to judge whether my hypothesis that the author of

above-mentioned work. They are as follows:</p>

      <div>For whom the Earth was made, the Sea, the Skies!</div>
      <div>So greatly high our human Bodies are</div>
      <div>That Angels scarcely may with these compare:</div>
      <div>In all the heights of Glory seated, they</div>
      <div>Above the Sun in Thine eternal day</div>
      <div>Are seen to shine; with greater gifts adorned</div>
      <div>Than Gold with Light or Flesh with Life suborned;</div>
      <div>Suns are but Servants, Skies beneath their feet;</div>
      <div>The Stars but Stones; Moons but to serve them meet.</div>
      <div>Beyond all heights above the World they reign</div>

      <div>Make by the Soul convey'd the Body shine,</div>
      <div>Not like the Sun (that earthly Darkness is)</div>
      <div>But in the strengths and heights of all this bliss,</div>
      <div>For God designed thy Body for His sake,</div>
      <div>A Temple of the Deity to make.</div>

<p>I do not think it is necessary to spend much time or ink in
endeavouring to prove that the author of these three poems must have
been also the writer of the other poems contained in this volume.
Unless it be contended that no conclusion as to authorship can be drawn
from similarity of style, sentiment, and peculiarities of expression,
I do not see how it is possible for any one who carefully considers
the matter to entertain a reasonable doubt about it. Not even the
hypothesis of imitation by one author of the style of another can here
be entertained&mdash;for no man can imitate what is not known to him.</p>

<p>Every poet has his special topics, his favourite terms of expression,
his peculiar vocabulary, and even his pet rhymes, which are bound to
appear often in his verse. I think it may be truly said that there
is nothing in the three poems taken from "A Serious and Patheticall
Contemplation of the Mercies of God" which cannot be paralleled in
the other poems contained in this volume. All are characterised by
the same fervent piety, the same command of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span> expression and musical
diction, the same dwelling upon the ideas that though God is necessary
to man, yet man also is necessary to God, and that the body (instead
of being, according to the ordinary theological belief, a <i>corpus
vile</i> of corruption) is "a spring of Joy" crowned with glory; and
the same continual allusions to the great natural phenomena. When to
these resemblances we add the many small coincidences of words and
phrases which are always recurring in the poems, the evidence of common
authorship becomes too strong to be resisted.</p>

<p>Perhaps it may be worth while to quote a few instances of these
resemblances out of the many which might be given. In the second stanza
of "The Person" we have</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div>Men's hands than angels' wings</div>
      <div>Are truer wealth even here below.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In "Life's Blessedness" we have</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div>So greatly high our human bodies are</div>
      <div>That Angels scarcely may with them compare.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In the fifth stanza of "The Estate" we have</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div>The laws of God, the Works he did create,</div>
      <div>His ancient ways, are His and my Estate.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In "The Ways of Wisdom" we have</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div>Who sees the heavenly ancient ways.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>In "Thoughts IV." we have</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div>The very heavens in their sacred worth</div>
      <div>At once serve us and set his Glory forth.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In "Life's Blessedness" we have</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div>The skies being made to serve me, as they do,</div>
      <div>While I Thy Glories in Thy Goodness view.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>In "The Influx" we have</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div>No soul but stone, no man but clay am I.</div>
    </div>

<p>In "Life's Blessedness" we have</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div>The stars but stones.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The reader will doubtless have observed that our poet was very fond of
using "treasure" and a "pleasure" as rhymes. He seldom omits to bring
them in in a poem of any length, and it will be observed that they
are introduced in "The Resurrection." Certain defective rhymes (or no
rhymes) also occur pretty frequently, as "lay," "joy," "away," "enjoy."
In "The Ways of Wisdom" we have "ways" and "joys."</p>

<p>I think I have produced evidence enough to convince the reader of the
soundness of my contention: if not, I will undertake to produce a good
deal more. It is fortunate, indeed, that "A Serious and Patheticall
Contemplation" should have stolen into print (for neither at the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
of its publication nor subsequently does it appear to have attracted
any attention), since without it we should have had no clue to the
authorship of these poems.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mr. W. T. Brooke has discovered in the British Museum a broadside with
the following title, "A Congratulatory Poem on the Right Honourable S<sup>r</sup>
Orlando Bridgman, Lord Keeper of the Great Seal of England," which, he
suggests, may possibly have been written by the author of the poems
here printed. But though it is a poem of considerable merit, it has,
in my opinion, no correspondence in style with Traherne's poems. A few
lines from it, however, will not be altogether out of place here:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<h2><a name="CONTEMPLATION" id="CONTEMPLATION">TRAHERNE'S "SERIOUS AND PATHETICALL CONTEMPLATION OF THE MERCIES OF GOD"</a></h2>

<p>This book would hardly be complete without some account of the above
work. It is a small 12mo volume of 146 pages, with an engraved
frontispiece. It is written&mdash;excepting the three pieces of verse which
I have already printed&mdash;in a kind of unrhymed verse, which is curiously
suggestive of the style of Whitman's "Leaves of Grass," particularly in
the frequent passages in which the author enumerates or catalogues, as
the American poet does, every object he can think of which bears any
relation to his theme. There were, of course, more points of unlikeness
than of likeness between the two poets, but they at least resembled
each other in their invincible optimism, as well as in the points
mentioned above. Whitman could not have known of the existence of the
"Serious and Patheticall Contemplation"; but had it been accessible
to him, it might well have been suspected that he was under some
obligations to it.</p>

<p>The booklet consists of a series of "Thanksgivings" for the Body, the
Soul, the Glory of God's Works, the Blessedness of God's Ways, the
Wisdom of His Word, &amp;c. There is much poetry and beauty of expression
in these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span> "Thanksgivings," and they are valuable also for the light
which they occasionally throw upon passages in the poems which might
else seem obscure. Thus the following passages from the "Thanksgiving
for the Body" may be profitably compared with "The Salutation" and
"Wonder":</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hangingindent">I will praise Thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made,
marvellous are Thy works; and that my Soul knoweth right well.</p>

<p class="hangingindent">My substance was not hid from Thee when I was made in secret and
curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.</p>

<p>Have we not here a very remarkable anticipation of the leading
thought of Whitman's "Leaves of Grass"? Do we not see in both poets
the same deep love of and delight in humanity, the same feeling of
comradeship and brotherhood with all men, the same hunger for sympathy
and reciprocal affection, the same pleasure in the common things of
life and nature, and the same frank acceptance of things as they are,
and not as they might be? I have said that there is more unlikeness
than likeness between the poets&mdash;but is it really so? Does not the
above passage show that beneath all apparent differences there was a
fundamental resemblance in their characters? To say the least, there
was this resemblance&mdash;that both of them found life supremely well worth
living, and never doubted, even when the clouds were blackest, that the
sun was shining beyond them.</p>

works and his friends. It comprises a number of essays, poems, and
short articles, some of which are certainly by Lamb, while others are

the guise of a humorous fiction, the story of a curious and hitherto
unknown incident in the author's life. Other pieces contained in the
volume, whether written by Lamb, or by imitators of his style, will be
found to be of quite remarkable interest and curiosity.</p>

<p class="center">By THOMAS TRAHERNE</p>

<p class="drop-cap p-left">Traherne is no less excellent as a prose writer than as a poet; indeed,
I think it is not too much to say that his prose will bear comparison
with that of any English writer of the seventeenth century. It is
remarkable for its ease, spirit, eloquence, and suppleness&mdash;qualities
which are not often found in combination in the writers of that period.</p>

<p class="center lg">[1602-1645]</p>

his Play entitled</p>


<p class="center xl p2">THE FLOATING ISLAND</p>

<p class="center"><i>NOW FIRST REPRINTED</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap p-left">There is no more singular circumstance in the history of English
literature than the fact that the writings of so fine a poet as William
Strode should have remained for such a length of time neglected and
forgotten. He had a great reputation in his lifetime, and his poems
were largely circulated in manuscript among the literary circles of
the time. His play, entitled "The Floating Island," which had been
performed before Charles I. and his Court in 1636, was published in
1655, with a preface in which the editors promised that if it met
with a good reception, more of the author's writings should follow.
This promise, however, owing perhaps to the political disturbances of
the time, was never fulfilled; and Strode has ever since remained a
mere shadow so far as any knowledge of his writings and personality
is concerned. With the publication of this volume he will take the
place to which he is entitled besides such poets as Carew, Cartwright,
Randolph and Corbet.</p>

<p class="center">Now first printed from manuscripts, most of which are in my own
possession.</p>

<p class="drop-cap p-left">This series, which will, I hope, extend to three or four volumes,
will consist chiefly of unprinted matter which I have discovered in
the course of my researches among manuscripts of the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries. The works of several authors not hitherto known
to fame will be included in the contents of these volumes. Among them
the names of Nicholas Oldisworth and M. Johnson may be particularly
mentioned. Both of them are writers of very considerable merit, and
are well worthy of being rescued from the obscurity in which they have
so long rested. Another feature of the collection will be copies of
the poems of many well-known writers, which will be printed because
the manuscript versions which I possess exhibit many variations from
the printed texts. Altogether, I venture to say that all scholars and
students of our old literature will welcome these volumes and recognise
their value.</p>

time, for it is, unlike "Christian Ethicks," a tolerably common book.
Fifteen years after its publication Dean Comber, a writer of some
note in his day, published a work of similar character, and with the
same title. As Traherne's book was published anonymously, Dean Comber
has usually received credit for that as well as for his own work. The
Dean was a man of considerable ability, and he would hardly have been
pleased had he been told that he would only be remembered in future
times as the writer who helped himself to a striking title at the
expense of one who was far superior to himself in character and genius.</p></div>

which the bulk of the poems in the present volume are derived, it
seems clear that there must be a considerable quantity of verse by
Traherne which has not yet been recovered. Appended to several poems
in the folio volume are references to other poems, as, for example,
at the end of "Innocence," "An Infant Eye, p. 1," and "Adam, p. 12."
Other poems thus mentioned are "News," "The Odor," "The Inheritance,"
"The Evidence," "The Center," and "Insatiableness." As the manuscript
volume containing these pieces consisted of at least 142 pages, it
seems likely that the present volume contains not more than one half
of Traherne's poetical works. It may be hoped, but hardly expected,
that the volume containing the poems mentioned above will some day be
recovered. Possibly this mention of it may, if it still exists, lead to
its eventual discovery.</p></div>
